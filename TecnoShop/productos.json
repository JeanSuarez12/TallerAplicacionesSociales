        "It was a great price during Prime Day. Purchased the laptop to replace my old laptop. Setting it up was pretty simple. Just followed the prompts, and it was ready to go in no time. I really like the faster speed and clear display.",
        "I bought this because my company laptop is a workstation and thus very heavy to carry for trips.  The company won't pay for the extra laptop, so I needed something low cost, light weight with a few hours of battery life that would run basic office apps and web surfing without lag.  So far this one works well.  I purchased the mechanically identical 2022 version with AMD Ryzen 3 and it was very slow - the curser would not keep up as you typed in a web address kinda slow.",
        "I bought the HP icore i3 lap top for the beginning of college. I have used it for quite a few months now and it still does everything I need. It connects to Wi-Fi quickly and loads quickly as well. I have experience some lagging however it has not been enough to make me frustrated with the lap top. I have not experienced any over heating and this is my first laptop to actually hold a charge for quite awhile. If you’re needing this lap top for school I would definitely recommend and I believe it is worth it’s value. The microphone and camera work well for a lap top and as long as windows S is disabled you are able to print things, use lock down browser and download an apps you may need. However, once you disable windows S you can not restore it so that can be a down side."

        "Easy to setup, boots up very quickly, fingerprint reader is very fast and convenient.  No bloatware pre-loaded, Great for the price.Had a small issue with the audio, but the manufacturer, Nimo, replaced it with a brand new one before I even got a chance to ship back the original!  I'm very impressed with the customer service and will look at Nimo computers again next time I need a laptop.",
        "Needed it for work and it is perfect !",
        "In today’s world, tech changes fast, but we all need it—and to have the convenience of a laptop takes us the extra mile. Every person we work with has a laptop anymore, and I’m always finding a need to upgrade. So when I saw this Nimo Quad-core laptop with a lot of extras, I had to try it.The laptop was packaged very well, with the nice quality spongy foam, not styrofoam. When I opened the laptop it had black protective fabric sheet that can be reused & kept inside when closing it to protect the screen from the keys. There was a very nice letter with info on Nimo's history and explaining the 2 year No-Worry Warranty & Hassle free 90 day return policy.The USB-C charging cord (6 ft!) was in a box next to the laptop. Battery life is pretty good. About 7 hours before it got low & it did pop up a message that it went into battery saver mode & should be charged.A very nice user manual made with an almost cardstock-like paper. It has very nice diagrams of what all of its ports are and function keys.It has USB 2.0 & 3.0 (x2) and a micro SD, HDMI, headphone combo plug in, 2 USB-c plug ins (1 for power cord), and a fingerprint reader!The trackpad is very responsive. I'm not usually a fan & use an external mouse most of the time, but this one is better than most. I really like that the keypad is nice to type on, the buttons are not too high or too slick. The only thing I wish was different is the 0 on the 10 keys is a little too far to the right to make it comfortable to use it if you are a fast typer on a 10 key pad. The right side shift key is a little smaller than I am used to but it's not bad. Super minor issues there.As far as internal specs, you can see them on the ad, and with the Windows 11 inside, I found it plenty fast for work operations.It is heavy enough that you know it is not cheaply made but not so heavy you feel like you are carrying a brick. The screen color is very good. It may be a 15.6 but seems larger.  The screen is nearly out to the edges. It has a very nice sheen to it that does not glare like some cheaper laptops do.  It is fast!!  It made my previous machine, an Asus Vivobook i-3 Intel, look as slow as molasses.All in all, I’m very pleased. Highly recommended!"

        "I used to have E210A when I was in London in 2021. One drawback of that old E210A was that it only had 64GB storage. There was not much space left after Windows upgrades and installations of apps. This 2024 model with a larger storage of 128GB has completely resolved the problem. When I saw it on Amazon, I immediately ordered one without hesitation.Sure it is slow, not a good tool for any complicated work. However, for me it is a perfect music player. It’s very cheap in price, small in size, light in weight, fanless, and with a respectable battery life. I installed a 2TB SSD and put all my music files on it. I then connected it with my Benchmark DAC3 HGC and active speakers. Running foobar2000 I am in the music heaven. I can also use it to listen to internet radios, Spotify, Apple Classical Music, and so on. It’s just BRAVO!And, hey, it still does well on basics like internet browsing and youtube videos. By paying such a small amount of money, I am completely satisfied.PS. For web browsing, use Edge instead of Chrome. Edge is faster and less demanding on ram tha Chrome in this low-end laptop.",
        "Excellent device Microsoft 365 and all that took a while to download everything but does what I need we'll now that it's all downloaded external hard drive recommended cause base programs eat the memory quick and at 3 g ram doesn't play games well so xbox app pre install is a bust",
        "Very inexpensive PC but with lots of features and capabilities for the money.  I wanted a compact PC to replace obsolete Surface Pro2, and this fits the bill.  More I/O ports than in product description including audio and HDMI.  Comes with Windows11. One negative is that it comes with Windows S-mode.  This blocks installing apps that Microsoft hasn't \"blessed\", and they push their own apps.  A REAL NUISANCE!  Shutting it off was a bit of a hassle, but figured out how to do it.  Then got computer set-up the way I wanted it.  S-mode is a Microsoft issue, not an ASUS issue, so can't really blame computer for this."

Not for gaming, but if optimized it can run minecraft at 60 to 150 fps which I count as a win very light, Not fast, decent solid color, but you can probably get a better one."

        "This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.",
        "Pretty good laptop. Will make a really good school or low level gaming laptop compared to latest games.It came with a 128gb 800mbps m.2 drive that was slow for windows 11 so upgraded it to 1tb 3500mbps m.2 drive. There are mixed reviews and info even from the manufacturer on if it has a extra ram slot or not but this one does not have one. All the ram is soldered to the motherboard and needs to be taken to an Acer shop in order to upgrade. Out of the box it used 6/8gb of ram at first then after the updates it dropped down to 4/8gb used. The system is pretty fast for only having 4gb free. The processor is the main feature I ordered it for since it is a 4core-8thread processor with speed ranging from 2.5ghz to 4.3ghz. After trying some more power demanding games the temp could still not pass 50c and stays quiet and cool to touch. It normally stays idle around 41c when not under a heavy load with no sound from the fans. The screen is decent quality but not meant for games since it's LCD and not being led the games get a bit of blur here and there with higher fps. Word of advice is when installing a different operating system the WiFi drivers do not reinstall with the system so any online activation is almost useless unless you have a usb-ethernet adapter. The battery lasts me around 6 hours in performance mode but in power saving mode could possibly last 9+ hours and way longer with some power setting tweaks. The graphics says 600mb dedicated and 3400mb shared but unlike a lot of systems all the shared moves straight to dedicated making it 4gb for the graphics. The value is pretty good and the appearance is slick. My older brother was checking it out and thinking of buying one now because of how well it does. Some upgrades to look into if you know what your doing is a new m.2 drive with a faster transfer rate and also possibly an upgraded 15.6inch screen that's 1080p-4k.",
        "I bought two of these laptops in the summer of 2020 for $299 and $310. The first thing I did was pull the stock memory and storage. I added 16 GB ram and put in 1 tb drives. I installed  Xubuntu Linux, later installed Debian Linux “bookworm” Release. with no driver issues. I added a USB 1 GB Ethernet adapter/hub combo to the 1 USB 3.1 port. This Laptop has a good screen and I like its lighted keyboard. Its Ryzen 3 3200U processor isn't fast, but its fast enough for my needs. I only use this laptop as a VPN internet share laptop for my work at home 2nd local area network. I could use an VPN router for this, but would get much slower internet speeds.  Using the laptop as an VPN share device I always get good internet speeds.  The second laptop I have as a backup, if the Linux OS gets a bad update and fails. It has happened 3 or 4 times where I had to use the backup laptop.  Minimal downtime that way. Always good to have a backup.The only thing I don't like about the laptop is that every so often I will get a blinking battery warning light. When that happens I unplug the ac power to the laptop and let the battery run down to 15%, then plug in the ac power to the laptop and good to go. No more warning light. I pull the bottom cover off once a year to clean the laptop and make sure the battery isn't showing signs of swelling. So far so good.  If that happened I would probably just pull the battery and run the laptop without a battery.  These laptops have been a good value for what I use them for. The laptop performs well running Linux, I would not be running windows on the laptop. I think its processor might be to slow for that. In its stock configuration 4 GB of ram would be a bad day for windows."

It's fast for what it is, works like a charm, and it can handle multiple tasks pretty well. Lightweight and doesn't overheat even after hours of use, charged up quickly too! Only complaint is the display is a bit washed out but other than that it's wonderful!",

My only complaint is that the alpha section of the keyboard and touchpad have a little bit of an awkward alignment that makes my right hand sit on top of the touchpad a bit too much.  I'll adjust with more time.",

But once I felt this laptop at Best Buy, I knew I had to find out more.It’s more functional and user friendly compared to the Mac. I keep forgetting the screen is touch enabled but love every time I accidentally touch it and it moves!The keyboard is amazing. The quality is just as great. I can’t say enough about it.Promise you’ll be happy with this laptop.",
        "Important: You will need to contact Microsoft Tech Support to get this laptop out of S Mode.Doing all the methods they recommend online will only result in a try again later message.  You will not be able to download or use any products Google related, or anything outside of Microsoft Store.  Tech support must go into your PC remotely to make multiple changes to the system and takes about 60 minutes which includes reseting the laptop.  Leaving my phone number with Microsoft tech support only took about 10 minutes to get a call back.  But once they are done fixing this, the system works great especially for the low price point."

        "My wife has a habit of going through laptops rapidly, because she tends not to want to spend a lot on them. I use Lenovo computers for work and home and have not found a brand that I prefer more.I bought this laptop for my wife because her then laptop was disconnecting from the Internet and was slow. It arrived quickly and was very well packaged. Set up was surprisingly easy and quick and the laptop itself is very attractive.Compared to my wife's old laptop, this new machine is fantastic, no disconnections from the Internet, it very quick and has an excellent display.I still find it hard to believe that I got such tremendous value for money with my purchase, it even got me in my wife's good books for a day!!!I am happy to recommend this product, it exceeded my expectations, was at a remarkably low price point, and my wife is delighted with her new laptop.",
        "So Hubby has needed a laptop for a good minute. We usually buy his refurbished bc he doesn't use a computer as much as I do. A #TB hard drive and top-shelf or even mid-level graphics card would be wasted on him, but he does need a laptop to access work files from home and general computer tomfoolery.So his last system was a refurb/open box Lenovo Ideapad, 4g RAM, and 1T hard drive. We got it from BestBuy Outlet a few years ago. It was so nice I told my sister about it and she got the same one.Fast forward to last December and the age was showing. I think the manufacture date is 2019, and it's showing the age. I was using it for work (WFH) bc he didn't need it. But then he DID need it so I had to go to a backup until he got me a desktop (see review).The BB Lenovo was slow, so very slow it was like Chinese water torture. Booting it up took time, yeah, 2-5 minutes depending on its mood. I'm not talking from shutdown. I mean from sleep/hibernation to lock screen to desktop. Painfully slow, so we needed to upgrade him.  We couldn't shell out a lot of money for it, though, so I went shopping.This system has good storage for him. He doesn't take enough pix or do enough browsing to need more than 512G so the extra 128G is just gravy. The 12G RAM is a major step up and he's no longer grumbling about how slow his computer is.Yay.I'm a little jelly. This thing is sleek. At this price, we could afford to grab another.  I just got a gamer desktop, though (see review!) so it's not practical.Pros: See abovePlus: That card slot is a good thing since it doesn't have a CD/DVD tray at all (see pic).The camera cover/lock is NICE (see pic). I always tape a little paper over webcams but there's no need with this.One of the USB ports is a USB-C (see pic), which is nice since things seem to be moving that way.I thought I was settling for the 15.6\" screen but it's not as small as I thought it would be. My desktop system monitors are 22 and 24 inches respectively and my last laptop was 17\", so 15\" feels small to me until I actually see it.As stated: Hubby doesn't care. This laptop is the same size as his old one and even the same manufacturer, so yeah. He's good.Cons:No disc tray. Anything he needs to physically add has to be on an SD card, thumb drive, or downloaded. Please note: Hubby doesn't care.For my geeky/gamer heart, it's not nearly enough HD space, but for Hubby it's perfect.The preinstalled bloatware insists on being used even when you uninstall it, but isn't it always?Minimal ports. I need way more USB ports and no ethernet is a deal breaker for me.Caveat: This laptop isn't for me, since I have a gaming/work desktop system. Hubby doesn't care about this at all, so it's just a \"that would be nice\" thing.Anyway,  I like this machine a lot. It's light and clean and a fantastic value for the price. I think it will serve Hubby well.9/10 would recommend."

        "I got the 15 inch, i needed this mostly for a good laptop, long battery life, USB C Charging, and price. I looked at several \"higher\" contenders, but for the 8g RAM, 64gb HD plus SD Card slot, battery life, size, and quality, you're not going to find a better sub- $300 chromebook. All others that compare are closer to $600-1000.Battery life isn't quite 11 hours with the most recent updates, more like 6-8. I use this primarily for online EHR for the facility I work for, and it's great. While some may not like the screen with more advanced (read as >$750 models), it is also a little blah appearing screen BECAUSE of the anti-glare. This means I can chart and do notes outside without sacrificing efficiency. Overall, the only \"missing\" thing is a touch screen. My main laptop is a Surface Pro 7, so I'm not really missing this. This is a fantastic true \"lap\" top.Unlike others, I have used other Chromebooks. This is superior for the PRICE.",
        "i bought this in feb. and it stopped working in june.

BTW, i am typing this on my old (very old) acer c720 which works great, just cannot be up graded to work with my bank.",
        "I love my new laptop, but the colors displayed on screen are just ok...not very vibrant, average for my own use, and can be fixed a bit tilting the screen at a better angle. I was online shopping and some of the clothing looked very light and images were not very saturated...I wouldn't recommend this for anyone using this laptop for design etc. Good for basic home use, work use, student use.  Beautiful background themes to choose from, excellent Google product use, and I easily installed a wireless bluetooth mouse. The screen is nice and large, especially at this price point of around $200. I bought this on Prime Day and I'm happy with my purchase. I can run Google with many tabs open without any problem. I do wish the speakers were a bit better. I listen to music on my phone or Alexa instead because the speakers are small and located in an odd place....right on the front outer rim of the laptop on either side of where it opens. I used it to watch a movie on my bed and had the volume at max and still had a little trouble hearing everything. The bedding also sometimes blocked the speakers because of their location. Basic volume on regular Zoom meetings, YouTube etc. would be fine. I recommend this laptop for normal basic use...it works fast, beautifully designed and has lots of ports which is very convenient. Another thing I wanted to mention is that it wouldn't turn on at first even after charging for hours. I had googled many troubleshooting ideas and nothing seemed to work. Finally after cursing it and almost giving up, it magically made a \"bling\" sound and came on. Make sure to charge it from a wall outlet; not an extension cord or power strip. I think it was still in shipping mode, so I had to google what keys to hold down to make it boot up for the first time. There are just those few things, otherwise I love the laptop for my needs, and would recommend Asus products. Touchpad is very quick and responsive. It is not a touch screen monitor...I'm thinking people are confusing touch screen with touch pad. Keyboard is comfortable and battery has been long-running."

        "Things I liked:1. Keys are really smooth to type with.2. Comes with keyboard lit keys which is outstandingly useful especially since I tend to work at night.3. Keyboard design is interesting, nonetheless unique.4. Tested it out with high-performance required software like Zoom, and worked perfectly fine with no stuttering.5. Incredibly lightweight and easy to carry around.6. Tested it out with a game like NFS MW (2012) and it worked perfectly fine with minor stuttering and decent graphics.7. The fingerprint scanner is one of a kind and incredibly beneficiary both security wise and feature wise for a laptop valued at under $500!8. The speakers are loud enough for someone to hear you from a bedroom across the hall, super amazed!9. Came with a great warranty to which I feel I won't be thinking of frequently considering how well Nimo constructed the design and UI of this laptop!10. Battery life is long-lasting, (this may vary on the number of tabs or software you're using).11. There's definitely more things to like about this piece of technology but as for now this is all I can think of.And if you're wondering about the things I didn't like well... there's really nothing not to like about this laptop... If you come here hoping for a laptop that can type for itself and read your mind then you're probably at the wrong spot but if you're here for a reliable and modernly advanced piece of technology that can accompany you with any task then, you're at the right spot.I bought the 512 GB version and overall, this is an amazing laptop that can be beneficiary with just about anything from attending zoom calls to handling business software to handling high-output coding software to which I sincerely feel, is a recommended buy!",
        "I bought this computer prior to starting a new position working remotely. The specs for this computer being much higher than specs for other computers of a similar price range. Even bigger plus was the color because, I love Rose Gold, okay? Even further, I loved that this computer was American-made by a small business and I am all for supporting that. I received it faster than expected. It was super nice, sturdy without being heavy. Nice, big screen, the camera has a privacy sheild. I love the full keyboard and the fingerprint feature. I abolutely adore the logo (side note haha) I am returning it only because I found that I needed a better graphics card- the four cores weren't quite cutting it but this is still a great price for this computer I just did not know I would need a more powerful card than the one in this machine but I am going with an upgraded version from this company and have already ordered it. I really hope more people buy from them. I think they have potential. Keep up the good work Nimo.",
        "Love the finger print reader although it only works like 60% of the time the first time. Lightweight, beautiful and sleek. So far really loving it. Also, the keyboard is backlit, has a 123 keypad on the side and the best part is it is charged by a Type C charger. Was also pleasantly surprised by the camera cover. Overall really happy with it!"

        "I liked this option for the ease of use since I really don’t need a regular laptop at this time in my life.  It is perfect for my smaller needs.  The price was great vs. a laptop, after my laptop dumped out.  It does everything I need it to do‼️. Very happy with my Chrome Book‼️",
        "This is the first lenovo and chromebook that I buy. I used to use windows hp and thought the endless updates were the norm until I was recommended this.At first glance, it looks good. The touchpad is responsive, keys aren't clacking loud, not too heavy. And it was very easy to set up. The screen looks good too.That said, haven't fully used it yet and will update as to how the performance and battery life will go.That said, right out of the box; I don't know if it's touchscreen or not. If it is, then either I haven't enabled it or the screen is not sensitive enough to register a touch.Update:I got the laptop in September third and charged it that evening. From then to now I left it on sleep mode and haven't touched it since. Today I open it up and am surprised that it's still at 90%~ charge. That's bonkers to me, my old one would doe within three hours of sleep mode.Still I'll update on the battery once I get to properly use it.As for the screen, it is not touch screen.",

        "This isn't the best PC laptop in the world, but likely one of the best PC laptops out there in the low $200 range. I ran it through a Passmark CPU benchmark and scored an 11,500 while attached to the charger which is quite impressive for this price range. I ordered this specifically for light duty use, and to replace a 14 year old Core i7 Dell Latitude that I ran HP Tuners software on to tune my hot rod. This Go 15 runs Win 11 Home very well. The first thing I did was take it out of S mode, deleted bloatware and other Microsoft apps that I will never use. After cleaning it up and updating it, I am thoroughly impressed with this PC, and how smoothly it actually runs. Especially since it was under $240 total with tax. The battery life seems great. I am certain it is severely lacking in battery in comparison to higher end laptops, but for what it is, 8hrs is excellent IMO. This is a huge upgrade over my old laptop, and I couldn't be happier with the purchase.Don't get me wrong, this is an entry level laptop for sure. If you game or heavily multi-task, get something with a more powerful processor and graphics. If you are a light user and want something that you can take with you, easily browse, easily stream video and hook up to a large TV... This will work well for that for sure.",
        "I bought this laptop for writing and taking online classes primarily, and it's just perfect.  Keyboard is nice to use.  Screen is bright and crisp.  Laptop is lightweight.This is NOT a laptop for gaming, video editing, demanding graphics work, and you're probably going to get frustrated if you are a busy, multi-tasker with multiple software and dozens of browser tabs open at the same time.That being said, for basic computing needs (word processing, watching Netflix, web browsing, blogging, writing a novel, taking classes, etc...), this laptop is near perfect and budget-friendly.Couple Notes: - The processor is 1.1 ghz, not 2.8 as listed in description, but really, you wouldn't be doing anything on this that should ever require that much processor speed. - Memory is upgradeable, which is nice, but I've found that 4gb is fine for what I'm using it for right now. - Laptop looks stylish, but lacks that \"high-end\" feel - but it's a $200 laptop.  Still, I like it and keyboard feels good for typing at length. - Screen is sharp.  Colors are decent.  Not the best screen out there, of course, but certainly not bad at all.  Not a touch screen...slight bummer but not a big deal to me. - Sound coming from speakers is nice and loud.  No, not premium sound, but sufficient to watch movies/video classes and hear it just fine.  I'm happy with it, but no audiophile.  Use headphones or a Bluetooth speaker if you want better sound. - Performance has been fast and I've been satisfied. - Easy to switch from Windows S to full Windows Home, which is my preference and why I opted for this over a Chromebook. - 81gb of available storage space after OS and apps take up a bit of the 128 gb drive.  To me, that's totally fine since I'm not saving anything on this - it all goes in the cloud. - I don't think the battery will actually last 9 hours with normal settings, but I get a solid 5 or so hours out of it between charges.RE: Slowness/Lagginess:A couple negative reviews mentioned this and when it happened to me, I thought that maybe there WAS something off about this computer.Turns out when I logged into my Microsoft account, it started syncing my existing desktop computer with this laptop, and with only 4gb of memory and slower processor, it just bogged it right down for about 20 minutes or so as it synced apps, desktop icons, etc....  Once everything synced up, it was fine and has been ever since.So if you experience slow, laggy performance when you first get this, and you've logged into your Microsoft account, set it down and let it sync for 20 minutes or so, or better yet, adjust the sync settings to be more selective.All in all, it's a great, inexpensive laptop that is super lightweight, super portable, looks nice, performs great, and is perfect for basic computing, an older child/teen, college courses, etc...",
        "UPDATED REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS -the battery life SUCKS. it lasts about 45 mins. i always have to keep the laptop plugged in. the laptop still takes forever to turn on when you hold the power button too. but besides all of that, roblox still runs great. which was my main use for the laptop. so if you want a affordable laptop just to use roblox, i recommend. just keep in mind you’d have to keep the laptop plugged in all the time, which can be annoying.i bought this laptop mainly for browsing, netflix, youtube, and roblox. this laptop runs roblox GREAT. no lag, no freezing, & the app loads up quickly. i’m so happy.— the PROS of this laptop:it works perfectly fine. i bought it used to save some money, and this laptop works like its brand new. the setup process was pretty easy, and its not slow loading up websites n apps. i was afraid that this laptop being in S mode would give me a problem, but i turned it off with a click of one button and that was it. S mode was turned off instantly and now i can download or search whatever website i want.— the CONS of this laptop:the sound quality isn’t the best.. and the screen quality isn’t the best either. is it doable? yes. have i seen better? also yes. also, this laptop takes a while to turn on, i have to hold the power button for 20 secs for it to turn on.-but anyways, i would recommend to anyone looking for a laptop on a budget!how did i turn S mode off? i wanted a new browser to use, so i chose google chrome. i went to download it, and it said something like “google chrome cannot be downloaded because this PC is in S mode” and it literally told me how to turn it off, it took less than 5 secs to turn it off. some other review said that they went through a lot to turn S mode off, so that’s why i was hesitant to buy this laptop, but everything ended up working out perfectly. i’m satisfied with this purchase tbh. i think it’s worth the money 100%."

        "list of reasons why this deserves 5 stars.1. looks cool.  it looks like carbon fiber.2. it's really fast.  don't know if it's because of the 16 gigs of ram or the 4 core processor but  it's really quick.3. the price.  this cost a little more than a notebook and you get a lot for it.4. all the connections i needed. .  hdmi for a second monitor ,  high speed 3.0 usb's to run my interface and a 3.0 usb-c.5. the hotface usb hard disc and power hub are really handy.  thanks for the great deal",

The battery life is impressive, lasting all day on a single charge, so I can work or relax without worrying about finding an outlet. I also appreciate the smooth performance for basic tasks, thanks to its efficient processing power.",
        "Windows S Mode and McAfee are glitchy performance killers and restrictive applications.  Switching out of Win 11 S mode should be a straight forward process but it just does not work as it should, along with McAfee installed, whether you want it or not.  McAfee acts like a worm virus, intrusively imbedding itself deep into system architecture instead of being a gate keeper like other anti-virus apps.  Windows S Mode dose not allow you to install and run any app that is not Microsoft verified and found on the Microsoft Store.  In S Mode, you cannot install and run any browser other than MS Edge or Bing.  There is an app within the MS Store to switch out of S mode but it will not work because, I suspect, of the bloated software that launches when you first turn on and set up this laptop.  Switching out of S Mode is permanent.  All the advise and direction I found to get this switch to work had failed.  Lots of frustrated people out there with the same issue.  I finally got MS Support on the phone and they told me this is a very common problem with this product and the only way to resolve it was to reset the PC.  A total reset, wiping the OS and all files you may have added.  No big deal as this is a new PC and I did not transfer anything from my old PC.  After the PC was reset, I was able to switch out of S mode so that I now have Win 11 Home instead of Win 11S Home.  At the same time, a McAfee install popup was automatically prompted so I could select Do Not Install.  This was all a bit of a pain but other than that, this laptop is not so bad.  The display colors are not as vibrant as I hoped but with a resolution of only 1365 x 768, I should have expected that.  However, the graphics display very well on a connected higher resolution monitor and it handles steaming video from Amazon Prime Video beautifully.  I hope this information can help someone avoid the frustration of dealing with what was intentionally sold as a very restrictive operating environment.  Getting rid of S Mode and McAfee gives you back unrestricted use of your laptop."

Gaming is buttery smooth even with maxed-out settings, and multitasking is seamless thanks to the powerful processor and ample RAM.The 16-inch screen with its high refresh rate is stunning. The colors are vibrant, the details are sharp, and the fluidity makes fast-paced games feel immersive and responsive.Sleek, modern, and undeniably ROG. The RGB keyboard is customizable and adds a premium feel, while the cooling system is highly effective and keeps the laptop running optimally even during long sessions.For a gaming laptop, the Strix G16 strikes a great balance between performance and portability. It’s lightweight enough to carry around without sacrificing the power you’d expect from a desktop replacement.While gaming laptops are known for short battery lives, the G16 pleasantly surprised me with its efficiency during non-gaming tasks.For the specs and performance this machine offers, it’s worth every penny. It’s an investment that will serve well for years to come.Whether you’re gaming, streaming, or editing, the ASUS ROG Strix G16 is a beast. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a reliable, high-performance laptop!",

        "I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday! Excellent purchase! Here is my pros and cons after a week of owning this:Con:1. 1920 x 1200 FHD 165Hz Display is very much an downgrade against my Legion 5 Pro 16\" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD 165Hz Display... But I guess with the parts offered, ASUS had to make some budget cuts somewhere I guess... (for the model I've chosen and not wanting to spend more than $1500 USD).2. Automatic MUX Switching is annoying... it optimizes which option to best suit for your current usage at the time (e.g. if you ran an game vs closing the game and brings you to the desktop). The automatic switch seems like its great and all but it ruins the display setting and when an game is playing, it switches again and sends you back to the desktop and ruins the display setting/resolution once more... Its best to just set it on the dedicated GPU option so you dont have to deal with this...3. Standard SSD Capacity is too low (again with cost saving measures but literally everyone these days just buy additional SSD stick anyways)... so snagged an SK.Hynix P41 SSD 2TB stick on sale to manually install for loading heavy application and games on there; really easy to install and easy to unscrew the back; there is an empty NVMe Gen4 M.2 2280 slot for you to install your SSDWorks Great after installing correctly and no Issues now! (make sure after install of SSD, just load into Windows and open up disk management to reformat (quick format! never full on SSD!) No need to tinker with BIOS setting...Do not tighten the SSD screws too much where the stick bends! thats incorrect! screw in ever so slightly so that the stick itself wont lodge out or move at all.Pros:1. RTX 4060 8GB - 140W Max TGP2. i7-13650HX - beats my Ryzen-7 5800H on my Legion 5 Pro3. RGB bar looks awesome!4. Battery 90WhNeutral:1. RGB Keys - heard mixed reviews on ASUS's design on this; of course, the Legion 5 RGB keyboard design is the best of the best but this is just okay and its not too bad in my eyes.2. Same weight and nearly the same dimensions as my Legion 5 Pro so portability is the same-ish but way better than my old MSI gaming laptop from 2017 where you can put this in your backpack and still have room to put other accessories and such.This is all I've noticed currently but either way, its a great mid-tier gaming laptop! I can run cyberpunk all max setting without issues or framerate drops and every other AAA game titles up to this point... This laptop should last an long time until AAA games becomes more graphically intense and requiring more processing power... but again this is the best you can get for your money and highly recommend!"

        "Very simple and functional yet it has all of the essentials without any of the gimmicky frills. Maybe it takes a $300 laptop so I don't have to deal with built in Alexa-enabled something, HP-specific ports, fingerprint scanner, and other stuff I don't want or need. They don't try anything fancy with this one which for me is a positive. Plus it's TKL keyboard which really should be the new norm. Does not have a backlit keyboard which is a slight miss but for the price it's not a huge deal.You can take it out of S-mode easily and remove a lot of the addons and you have yourself a perfectly functional Windows machine. Despite the lower-tier hardware it still starts up very quickly if you make sure you don't have too much bloatware. Sure it's a little slow at times but if you're using it for day to day tasks it should be fine. Battery life seems very good, the laptop is also fairly lightweight as well. What more could you ask for at this price point.",
        "I recently purchased the HP Newest 14\" Ultralight Laptop and let me tell you, it has been an absolute game-changer for both my student life and my business needs. As someone who is always on the go, I needed a reliable laptop that could keep up with my busy schedule, and this laptop has exceeded all of my expectations.Let's start with the design - this laptop is sleek, lightweight, and portable, making it perfect for carrying around campus or taking to meetings. The 14\" screen is the perfect size for both work and play, and the Intel Quad-Core N4120 processor ensures that everything runs smoothly and quickly. The 8GB of RAM and 192GB of storage (64GB eMMC + 128GB Micro SD) provide more than enough space for all of my files, photos, and videos.One of my favorite features of this laptop is the 1 Year Office 365 subscription that comes included. Having access to all of the Microsoft Office programs has made it so much easier for me to stay organized and productive. The webcam is great for virtual meetings, and the HDMI, WiFi, and USB-A ports make it easy to connect to external devices and accessories.But what truly sets this laptop apart is its incredible value for the price. I was a bit hesitant at first because of how affordable it is, but I can confidently say that this laptop is worth every penny. The performance and quality are on par with laptops that cost twice as much, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.In conclusion, if you're a student or a business professional in need of a reliable, efficient, and affordable laptop, with amazing battery life, look no further than the HP Newest 14\" Ultralight Laptop. It's a 5-star product that will truly make your life easier and more enjoyable. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!.",
        "5/31/2024Update: Revised review to 4 stars from 1. If you're lured to these by an Amazon flash offer, and begin to compare other options/offers, be sure to throughly compare the descriptions. Or you'll purchase something you didn't want. If you find this out after you set everything up and there is no problem with the computer itself, you're stuck with it. The other issue I had was the inability to exit Win 11 S mode. After hours of trying the standard method and several youtube videos with complex work arounds, I gave up. Today I decided to express my feelings in the MS Edge search window and I received this response from Copilot. (posted in the picture above). I post because subsequent requests produced different results. This work around worked quickly and was a three step fix. Have exited S mode and am happily running Google Chrome. Plus all my Google info and files from my broken laptop ported over. One last note: this is definitely a computer for students. It is priced reasonably considering post Covid greedflation prices. It is comparetively slow and not for use use for gamers. I will keep it as I need a computer for research and writing papers.5/30/2024-My laptop broke. Needed to complete paperwork for a project with tight time lured by \"Deal\" for laptop with 4GB ram 64 storage Bluetooth, Wi-Fi. $169, 12hr delivery.  I figure it was good enough to get my work done. At the site several other options were available with the same features and more memory. All had delivery dates of 1=2 days except 1 with 8GB ram, 192GB storage for $259 w/ $40 coupon, Thought extra memory and storage was worth extra $90. Computer arrived. It took an 1-1/2 hr to do updates. When I tried to download Chrome to work in Google docs {state recommended for changes}. This computer is locked into MS S mode blocking download of apps not in MS store. After spending 2hrs trying  different S mode exit directions is was resolved to doing the work on my Samsung S20 which took 3 hours to do 1 hr of work. This computer doesn't have Bluetooth, is extremely slow. MS locks y into using Edge in a worse case scenario than they did with Explorer 25 yrs ago. Don't be lured by the free1yr of Home 365. Cannot return because I used it and is technically not broken. HP is obviously returning to the days of cheap low-grade Compaq. Clearest example of Greedflation. It also moved data from broken laptop creating what will be hours of scrubbing to sell at 1/2 price on Ebay."

        "Ok, So the Celeron N100 is not blazing fast, but for everyday tasks, this is plenty fast.  I don't do gaming, but understand from those that do, this would be a low-end gaming speed chip. Battery lasts over 6 hours for average tasks, the display is super crisp at 1920 setting, latest wifi 6, backlight keyboard which is omitted on most budget laptops, getting used to the fingerprint login but it has worked well. 16G of ram is recommended over 8, which i got and can easily have multiple items open and quickly move back and forth. The 1T SSD drive boots up quickly (about 30 seconds to get thru login and on desktop from off) vs. old school hard drives. Had a question of seller and they were quick with communication. THE BEST PART:  a 2 year warranty, which most competitors only offering 1 year, at best.Ok, so this is an update--I still think this is a 5 star for the money, BUT.  I used TEAMS for the first time and the audio is not awful, but it's not great either, so if you do a lot of that type activity then that could be an issue if you do not use headphones for zoom or teams calls.",
        "I have been shopping for a new laptop to replace my Windows 7 Laptop.  This is my third Laptop and the search finally ended when I read all of the great reviews of this NIMO laptop computer. I agree with most of the reviewers and love the lightness, key velocity, and the 1 TB of storage. It is pretty quick and although I haven't used it extensively-because I'm still  setting it up and learning Windows 11 Home, it's been a pleasure to use. I  LOVE the backlit keys which come on when you type, so no more external lights necessary at night, and  the warranty is great at 2 years.  The picture is sharp, and the case is sturdy and not cheap. It is  attractive in Ocean Blue. I am also proud it's assembled in the USA and I couldn't be any happier.",
        "I waited a couple of months to write this review, to see how well it would hold up after the HP debacle.I like this notebook! From the cute little fishy logo to the fingerprint logon, this notebook works like a charm. I haven't had a single hiccup trying to get it to work. I'm not a power user, mostly working on the internet (with a couple dozen tabs open simultaneously), and MS office light. I can't comment on power gaming, that's not my jam. The battery does have a significant life where I don't feel like I have to charge it every day. The fingerprint scanner is a bit fussy, but no more so than my phone.If there was any improvement I would have liked to see, it would be the number pad on the right side of the keypad. Why put the decimal at the top, above the 9 key? If you've ever looked at an adding machine, you'll see that the decimal is at the bottom. That slows me down when entering a column of numbers.If you anticipate doing a lot of numeric data entry, I'd suggest you continue searching. But for general internet work, word processing and the like, this notebook fits the bill."

        "I bought the Apple 2022 MacBook Air with the M2 chip two weeks ago, and I was pleasantly surprised at the price. I primarily use it for web browsing and software development, and I don't have many programs on it. Setting it up was seamless, especially since I have other Apple products. I encountered no issues during the setup.The Midnight color looks fantastic and is the best quality Air I've ever used. The display and sound are great. While I haven't tried video processing, the M2 chip performs wonderfully. It's noticeably faster than my Mac mini with the M1 chip. I love the size and weight; it's perfect for bringing to the coffee shop. It also seems more durable than my girlfriend's 2020 Air.The battery lasts at least 8 hours on a single charge, and I can use it at work for a significant portion of the day without needing to recharge. The new charging port style secures via a magnet, which works fine, though it could be a bit stronger.Overall, I'm thrilled with the price, especially since I've never had a Mac under $1,000. I'm very happy with this purchase and give it 5 stars.",
        "This is amazing. The athletic is amazing and the thinness is unparalleled, I love the MagSafe charging. The m2 chip is speedy and is super snappy, it can handle everything. The battery is noticeably long on it also. The most surprising is the speaker sound quality, I was not expecting the amazing quality from this slim computer.",
        "I needed a laptop to separate work from personal activities.  I thought about getting a Chromebook, but the ones reported to have better build quality were almost as expensive as Windows and Mac laptops.  When the MacBook Air M2 went on clearance sale, I jumped on it.  I use a MacBook for work, so it is a plus not having to keep two systems in mind.  I had seen concerns in reviews about 8 GB memory being insufficient, but I find it very responsive for my light use: email, web browsing, some word processing and watching videos. I don't play video games or do video editing.  The screen is nice and big enough for me, and the keyboard has a nice solid feel.  Battery life is more than good enough for a machine that I mostly use at home."

The M1 MacBook Air is/was an excellent budget laptop during grad school even with the base 256GB storage. However, I'd always struggle to offload and download files when I got more photography gigs, especially dealing with RAW files. I averaged 200GB on and off, so seeing that I am still less than half of the 512GB storage now is comforting.RAM:The 16GB of RAM flies through my workload with ease. No more \"Swap Use\" Memory from the former 8GB RAM I had, which is a plus. I throw all sorts of demanding tasks including Google Chrome, LightRoom, Ableton + Nexus, LogicPro, FruityLoops Studio, etc. Still under the 16GB usage.My thoughts:Typing this on the new M4 MacBook Pro, and it is noticeably a better experience for my productivity and day-to-day workloads. This isn't even the \"M4 Pro\" or the \"M4 Max,\" and I am happy with it. Worth every penny.Overall, this is perfect for anyone who is a student, a creator, an artist, or anyone who just loves the efficiency and convenience of being in the macOS atmosphere. Worth."

        "Purchased for my son’s 13th birthday. The Acer Nitro V gaming laptop has exceeded his expectations! The graphics are impressive, and games run smoothly even on higher settings. The cooling system works well and keeps the laptop from overheating, even during longer sessions. The display is bright and clear, and the 144Hz refresh rate makes gameplay super smooth. The build is sturdy and has a sleek, gamer-friendly design. Battery life isn’t the longest, but that’s expected for a gaming laptop. For this price point, it’s an excellent choice for gamers who want solid performance without breaking the bank. Highly recommend!",
        "Computer itself is really good and fast.  The only thing that slows it down is MS Windows as you know.  I have used windows from the start. I used Windows XP right up to 2020, when Internet Security protocols stopped their support, XP was the best, and Windows 7 was the last best.  After Windows 7 MS windows went down hill.  If Apple would have more user friendly programs, or Apps as they are called nowadays, a lot more people would be switching over.  As well as the open software platforms such as Linux, etc.  But MS pretty much had a monopoly on the OS being sold on new computer sales and that is how they got so big so fast, and why people did not have too much of a choice, and therefore got used to using the MS windows OS.  As you probably know, all the trouble came from the windows updates, anything and everything thatcould go wrong came from the updates. That is why I was able to use my Windows XP until 2020, I neverdid updates.  You are probably thinking then why am I buying this computer as MS now forces updates to go throughon all newer computers with their OS on it, as they want to keep control of everything that you do now and want to know everything that you are searching for.  Well I got so used to using windows. I like the interface interaction, and now I have to do a lot of manipulating to get the files and such working as older versions. But, once you do, it gets better.  Of course I disable updates and Edge.  So after a little tweaking this computer works well, although not like MS intended it to work.  And one feature of all windows, which I think is the best, (MS will probably do something to it after I post this review) is the backwards compatibility feature. With this feature you can load an older version ofSoftware or an old Game and it will work on the newer computer. As an example I am using Software Programs that are close to twenty years old and Games that are sixteen years old.",
        "I've had it for a year now, no problems at all. I'm not heavily into gaming, so I don't expecto top performance from it and I knew this before ordering it. All the games I've played in it haven't had any issues. CPU is powerful but tends to heat up A LOT if using RTX's DLSS in games. Other than that, everything is fine."

        "So glad I got this. I didn't need it for anything intense, this is a casual personal laptop, I'm not bitcoin mining or running enormous spreadsheets. Mostly just watching youtube and doing a bunch of Zoom meetings. After setting up windows 11 and making sure the laptop was generally functional, I upgraded the RAM to 32GB which resolved some initial slowness. With 8GB of RAM out of the box it was running at 66% usage. For a new laptop that's not good, but not a problem for me. If I was going to upgrade RAM anyway, I'm glad it only came with 8GB. Saved me money in the end.After updating windows, updating the drivers, and updating the BIOS, this thing is better than what I could have hoped for. Battery life seems acceptable and the keyboard is actually RGB, which I didn't realize. I thought it was just going to be a static white keyboard backlight, so the colors were a pleasant surprise.I haven't tested the gaming capabilities yet. I am not expecting it to run something like Helldivers II, but I could easily play Skyrim with the higher resolution graphics. Will update this review once I test gaming but, 10/10 if you need a practical and reliable laptop that will likely last you a long time.Edit: It runs Helldivers II seamlessly, no lag, fantastic rendering. Buy it.",
        "Let me preface by saying the last time I purchased a new laptop was in 2005 (Acer Aspire 3000) and while tablets are nice for on the go, my digital life was a hot mess. I needed something that wasn't wafer thin flimsy and that didn't cost an arm and a leg. I am by no means a gamer, nor do I play PC games but I was still looking for a laptop that had some heft to it. I stumbled across this one mainly because it was suggested by amazon and the price seemed right even though its a 2021 model. After reading reviews and comparing bewteen this and the similar price/spec Acer Nitro, I chose this one because upgrading the RAM and adding an additional SSD drive wouldn't require a doctorate in computer science.As far as upgrades are concerned I also purchased the crucial 64GB (2x32gb) set as well as a 2TB Crucial NVMe SSD drive when I ordered this as mentioned by an earlier reviewer. The install took all of 10 minutes to pop the back cover off and slip in the new RAM/SSD modules and I was ready to fire this baby up. I figured I would just max the RAM (64GB) and beef up the storage and be done with it so opening the back cover wouldn't be necessary any time soon.Initial setup was pretty straightforward with Windows 11 and once I got to the home screen I got into the settings and performed all the necessary windows updates as well as the updates for the bundled Asus graphics software. Aside from the McAfee antivirus and the Microsoft 365 trial programs, there was no other bloatware to be found. Once those were uninstalled I was able to customize settings to my liking.The laptop comes as advertised, I wasn't expecting 15 USB ports on this nor do I require that many. The keyboard is very nice and is a full size with a slightly smaller than normal 10 key number pad. Keys are nice and clicky, not mechanical but also not a mushy membrane either. The backlit keys are a nice touch and can be customised to your liking as long as it's all the same color. It has about four different modes for pulsing lights or strobe or just on always. The trackpad is great and has the physical right and left mouse buttons and it is mostly centered so you dont brush the trackpad when typing.Out of curiousity I tried the online benchmark test to see how this machine ranked, and surprisingly with the RAM upgrade it ranked in the 92 percentile range (see photos) and the graphics were very smooth ranging anywhere from high 60's to 130 FPS on ultra settings.As mentioned I am not a PC gamer but hopefully this information will be helpful for those that do partake. I may run some console emulators at some point, but for now I'll just be enjoying the soft glow from the keyboard lighting."

I just wish they could do better in the display department, 165hz is a bit slow for a system with a 4080, and the FHD 480hz resolution leaves a lot to be desired in the 18in model. I have the 360hz FHD display on my M15 R5 that has a 3070 gpu, and its great for the smaller screen, I would really like to have been able to get this one with a UHD 4k option, also sound card is lacking. Speakers are the exact same junk that they used on my smaller laptop, considering there are smaller form factor machines in this size that they have managed to stuff a subwoofer inside of, Alienware is still late to the party when it comes to gaming devices and I believe Dell being largely to blame as their niche has always been in the office segment. They really need to step it up in their display technology as well as audio delivery if they are ever going to be as nice as Razer and MSI laptops in my opinion. Granted, I would have had to spend another 1000 dollars to get a Razer Blade 18 with similar specs.",
        "For the price of this laptop I expect it to perform better than my 4 year old $1200 MSI.This Alienware laptop has been glitchy and has made simple task such as opening a program or even trying to turn the laptop off difficult…. Trying to open programs such as Diablo or WoW would take several minutes…. Even after updating drivers and contacting customer support nothings improved. I’ve heard only good things from Alienware so I’m extremely disappointed in the quality of product I’ve received. My next laptop or computer WILL NOT BE A DELL/Alienware.",
        "I've tried just about every name brand laptop in this category (gaming laptops) and this was the only one (Alienware) that I did not try.  The reason I didn't try was because of all the not-so-great reviews and how the cons were just simply not 'acceptable' for 2024.  After much trial and tribulation, I figured I had nothing left to lose except to not try this brand.  Well low and behold!  This laptop was PERFECT for me!  I wanted a portable AND capable Beast and this fit the bill PERFECTLY!  It maybe a little chunky for people who don't eat meat or work out, but for me it was a very acceptable compromise for what I was looking for in a laptop (a consistent gaming experience whether at home or abroad).  It plays all my games at max settings without any problems at all.  Others I've had always ended up throttling themselves (despite being 'higher spec'd' than this one) and either stuttered or over-heated to the point it would lock up or shut down.  This laptop might get a little 'loud' but it never over heats, never shuts down, and to my surprise, never throttled, not even once.  I bought a laptop backpack for this laptop here in Amazon (just look up backpacks for 18.4\" laptops).  It works PERFECTLY for my needs.  Tech Support is practically built right into this machine too.  Most questions I had about anything was easily found with the included software packages.  I have no regrets with this purchase and can easily recommend this to people who want a great laptop and a Beast without all the marketing and fluff (and failures) of the other 'Top Tier' or 'Higher Spec'd' laptops out there (looking at you ASUS and LENOVO).  Oh wait, I do have one regret, and it's that I didn't get this sooner and let my own bias and the bias of other laptop 'Professional Reviewers' sway me away from this brand early on during my searches for the PERFECT laptop for ME."

        "My husband (Matthew) and I recently purchased the 2024 MacBook Air 15-inch with the M3 chip to help organize everything in my café, and it has been an exceptional tool.

Five stars!",
        "The glass on my prior MacBook Pro broke.  Not worth replacing since the laptop was more than five years old.  When I went to purchase a new MacBook Pro, I learned that Apple eliminated the 15\" screen on the new MacBook Pros (I think this was dumb).  The 13.4\" is too small and the 17\" is way too big and heavy.  The salesperson at a retail store  suggested I look at the MacBook Air (Caveat: I do not do any heavy graphics, animation, editing or video/photo work), so the M3 Chip, 16GB, 512GB is more than adequate.  I was able to purchase this 15.3\" Laptop with 3 years of Apple Care at $300.00 less than the retail store. This is a terrific laptop for everything.  I don't do any video or editing, so your needs may be different.  But I constantly run Acrobat Pro, Excel, Word, and other programs simultaneously and it is fast.  The screen is terrific, it has built-in retina display and the images are super crisp.  I watch movies on this laptop and I have no issues with the display.  If you are needing a new MacBook and the price of the new MacBook Pros made your eyes water, I highly recommend the MacBook Air."

The speakers aren't great, but that doesn't matter if you're using headphones. This is not the best laptop to carry around with you as it's pretty heavy, but that helps to give it a feeling of durability and high quality.

The new one is very light, the keyboard is familiar, and the battery life is awesome. I find myself carrying this one around the house, on the outdoor deck, and in the basement.  The old PC was heavy and had 1-2 hours battery life.  Other laptops maybe better, but this one was rated highly and has exceeded my expectations. Levono seems to have made the start up process practically painless.  When I the found my passwords were retained it was a true blessing and a big surprise.",

The battery last about 5 hrs fully charged. It has excellent storage space. In order to download apps outside of the Microsoft store you do have to turn off S mode. The screen quality is nice for the price the sound is decent I have watched YouTube videos on here and the sound was pretty good.  I haven't experienced any issues and im on week 2 of owning it."

        "I’ve had the Lenovo Yoga 14” forever, and the one thing I put up with is the international charger, but that requires me to bring an international adapter everywhere I go if I want to use or bring my personal laptop. Finally took the plunge and got a decently affordable laptop here in the US after 10 years.This laptop is super lightweight at 1kg+. Battery life is decent so far, with normal usage it seems to last about 4 hours. Makes it super convenient to bring around the house without its charging cord for a Zoom or Whatsapp call. It’s really light compared to my very ancient laptop. The laptop comes with a decent front facing camera for calls, but it’s not super sharp. It’s more than sufficient for family calls.One thing that was odd to me was that the charging cable is a DC cable, wasn’t expecting that but because the cable is so small/lightweight it doesn’t bother me too much. Just something to note that it isn’t very “interchangeable” so if you wanted to borrow a charger at Starbucks from a person next to you that might be a problem.I had no trouble setting it up and connectedto Wifi and Bluetooth devices fairly easily. I love that there are USB3.0, USB2.0 and even a mini HDMI port. The USB3.0 is great. My old laptop really only had 1 USB port so it was tough when I had to connect to multiple things.Display is fantastic and sharp. It is actually surprising for what I was expecting, more than met expectations here. Keyboard is a bit plasticky, but it is light to the touch and responds well. Touchpad requires a bit “more” push so I’m going to see if I can tweak the settings to make it more responsive. The touchpad is definitely one of those that feels more plasticky, so for longer term use it might not be great.. I like the more “matte” feeling better. Either way I’ll be using a mouse so it doesn’t bother me very much but just something to note especially for business users.I’d say all in all this is a great budget buy for a personal laptop. Not something I’d get for business use, but more than meets expectations for personal!",
        "This Jumper 14\" laptop is a great choice for everyday use. 12GB RAM and a 256GB SSD provide smooth performance for multitasking, and the Intel Celeron J4105 CPU handles basic tasks with ease. The FHD display is sharp and clear, perfect for work or streaming. I also appreciate the lightweight design that makes it easy to carry around. Good battery life and reliable dual-band WiFi. Highly recommended for work or casual use!",
        "Received the laptop quickly and the set up took about 30 minutes including windows updates. The design is sleek and the color is exactly what I need. The screen is vibrant and great to watch videos. It would be nice if it were touch screen. The laptop runs very smooth and do not have any issues so far. Plan to use this laptop for daily family use, checking emails or basic office softwares. Happy with the purchase!"

        "My favorite laptop! fast, never lags.  never drops wi-fi or bluetooth signals.  Can and do work on the Microsoft Edge, which was new to me but it works flawlessly.  Back to the computer.. never heats up, charges up quickly, has a decent battery life.  Keyboard is an 8/10.. It feels great and comfortable on the fingers, tactile feel.. Trackpad is pretty good as well.. Took me a while to adapt due to coming from Apple beforehand and was searching for that command key for the longest haha, but the learning curve was fairly simple for me.  Good sound as well.  The display is not the best, but it's good for most people.  Feel as though it could be more vibrant.  Easy to start up and shut down, both are quick.  I like the Lenovo, that  camera blind is a cool feature.  Nice size and comfortable for the around eight hours per work day that I use it.  Go buy it! (no proof-read)",
        "I'm very happy with what I got for less than $700.  Pretty respectable specs, extremely light.  It's a great daily driver to do all my email, word processing, messing around with YouTube, etc...  I haven't tried dev with it yet, but it might even be good enough for lightweight development.One thing I would improve is the mouse pad, although the mouse pad imo hasn't been good on laptops since the very first IBM Think Pad from the mid 1990's which had a little joystick for a mouse, so you could mouse and type at the same time.  I've never seen a mouse pad be very accurate and they're always cumbersome to use.  Since Lenovo bought the Think Pad brand, maybe they could dig that tech up and do a reboot.",
        "fast, but limited by browser javascript overloading the ram cache. this is unavoidable b/c as a software developer, the idiots that make web pages these days overload them with so much garbage they dont run properly. this has nothing to do with the quality of this laptop.now that i'm done venting, let's get to why this machine is great.1. boot time is blazingly fast (<8s to windows screen)2. nice and roomy storage (got 1tb) which is one of the main factors of me buying over mac. (VERY tough choice - but i have an old macbook air for now)3. i needed this machine for development, and like the nice tie in to windows onedrive, really gives me an easy way to manage my file repository.4. keyboard is good but i like beveled keys better (no backlight)5. overall great machine for the money, if you want all the bells and whistles you will be spending > 7-800 clams.  my reccomendation is that if you don't care about touchscreeen, get a macbook air 2024 for $850.6. nice screen size, i don't care about the image quality b/c i'm coding on this thing. its a great price b/c if it breaks, is stolen, etc, i can buy a new one. i would cry sweet tears if the macbook broke.note: this is NOT a gaming machine. if you want to game, get a console, its the best way to go. if you are a pc gamer you need to spend north of 1k to get anything decent.overall, one of the best in its class for barebones with good power. if you want bells and whistles, fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, touchscreen, etc, you'll have to spend more. i went for raw power and storage, with good screensize. it was a very tough choice over mac but i came up as a developer with windows and i'm going back. i like the mac shell but powershell cuts the mustard now.for $500 with windows pro, this is a great developer machine. very happy with it so far.giving it a 4/5.no comment on battery life yet... probably ok."

Only while charging the games lagged and stutter very severly, running games on battery everything was smooth. ASUS was not much helpful as in what could be the issue. So a little research revealed that the laptop did not  have a correct setting for the fans while charging. Downloading a 3rd party program fixed everything. The name of the program is Ghelper. Watch a video first as you have to uninstall some programs first. Still the laptop runs fairly hot, but the games look great with no stuttering."

        "I’m not sure what some of the bad reviews are about. I am very happy with this purchase. Computer works great and very fast. Battery life may not be the greatest, but I’m satisfied with it. The keyboard is not back lit, but I already had an HP computer so I’m not surprised by this one not being back lit. Thankfully, I know how to type so it’s not that much of an issue to me. I like that you can block the camera, great sound quality and video quality. Set up was very easy, just copied everything over from a back up drive",
        "I do a lot of word processing at work and internet releated searches and needed a laptop to use when I work at my conference table. I wanted one that had plenty of quick  SSD memory, ample RAM, a large enough screen and good keyboard for a reasonablel price. I don't do graphics or watch HD movies and wasn't looking for something loaded.I am very happy with this computer. The keyboard is outstanding! Maybe the best laptop keyboard I have ever used. The keys are firm enough that I am not accidentally entering letters just from the light pressure of my fingers resting on them but tactile and responsive with almost a \"click\" giving feedback that the key has been struck. The screen is nice and wide and my documents look full size. The speaker is fine for my needs (I'm not listening to a symphony while I work) and the volume goes up nice and high. The camera is very good and more than sufficient for video conferences. It is an office workhorse.",
        "For the money, this is a good machine, and for the record, I would buy it again. It has good resolution and is fast for its price point. One area of disappointment is the battery life. The description stated long battery life and 9 hours. I get about 4 hours while working. Maybe they meant 9 hours if your laptop was asleep and not being used. All said, other than the battery, it is a good laptop."

I still wouldn't be too rough with it because I'm not sure how sturdy the connection to the display is, but overall it's a good tool for college or office work.Update: The battery life could be improved. After taking it to class recently and not plugging it in, it went from 100% to 50% in about 2 hours. During this time frame, I was using Microsoft one note and google chrome primarily. I don’t think these 2 applications cause too much energy drain normally (especially compared to when using it on my phone). I’ll be looking into improving the battery performance somehow."

        "I bought gram laptop with 15.6inch touchscreen display, 32gb ram, i7 cpu, 1tb ssd. I rate 4 stars because keyboard does not have seperate home, end, pg up and pg down keys. You need press fn + arrow keys which is annoying. Sometimes touchscreen works by itself when you open or close the screen. You need to press screen edge firmly to change the view angle. Everything else is perfect. I recommend lg gram laptops...I even bought another one with nvidia grafics for my sister for 3d modeling tasks."

        "So glad I got this. I didn't need it for anything intense, this is a casual personal laptop, I'm not bitcoin mining or running enormous spreadsheets. Mostly just watching youtube and doing a bunch of Zoom meetings. After setting up windows 11 and making sure the laptop was generally functional, I upgraded the RAM to 32GB which resolved some initial slowness. With 8GB of RAM out of the box it was running at 66% usage. For a new laptop that's not good, but not a problem for me. If I was going to upgrade RAM anyway, I'm glad it only came with 8GB. Saved me money in the end.After updating windows, updating the drivers, and updating the BIOS, this thing is better than what I could have hoped for. Battery life seems acceptable and the keyboard is actually RGB, which I didn't realize. I thought it was just going to be a static white keyboard backlight, so the colors were a pleasant surprise.I haven't tested the gaming capabilities yet. I am not expecting it to run something like Helldivers II, but I could easily play Skyrim with the higher resolution graphics. Will update this review once I test gaming but, 10/10 if you need a practical and reliable laptop that will likely last you a long time.Edit: It runs Helldivers II seamlessly, no lag, fantastic rendering. Buy it.",
        "Let me preface by saying the last time I purchased a new laptop was in 2005 (Acer Aspire 3000) and while tablets are nice for on the go, my digital life was a hot mess. I needed something that wasn't wafer thin flimsy and that didn't cost an arm and a leg. I am by no means a gamer, nor do I play PC games but I was still looking for a laptop that had some heft to it. I stumbled across this one mainly because it was suggested by amazon and the price seemed right even though its a 2021 model. After reading reviews and comparing bewteen this and the similar price/spec Acer Nitro, I chose this one because upgrading the RAM and adding an additional SSD drive wouldn't require a doctorate in computer science.As far as upgrades are concerned I also purchased the crucial 64GB (2x32gb) set as well as a 2TB Crucial NVMe SSD drive when I ordered this as mentioned by an earlier reviewer. The install took all of 10 minutes to pop the back cover off and slip in the new RAM/SSD modules and I was ready to fire this baby up. I figured I would just max the RAM (64GB) and beef up the storage and be done with it so opening the back cover wouldn't be necessary any time soon.Initial setup was pretty straightforward with Windows 11 and once I got to the home screen I got into the settings and performed all the necessary windows updates as well as the updates for the bundled Asus graphics software. Aside from the McAfee antivirus and the Microsoft 365 trial programs, there was no other bloatware to be found. Once those were uninstalled I was able to customize settings to my liking.The laptop comes as advertised, I wasn't expecting 15 USB ports on this nor do I require that many. The keyboard is very nice and is a full size with a slightly smaller than normal 10 key number pad. Keys are nice and clicky, not mechanical but also not a mushy membrane either. The backlit keys are a nice touch and can be customised to your liking as long as it's all the same color. It has about four different modes for pulsing lights or strobe or just on always. The trackpad is great and has the physical right and left mouse buttons and it is mostly centered so you dont brush the trackpad when typing.Out of curiousity I tried the online benchmark test to see how this machine ranked, and surprisingly with the RAM upgrade it ranked in the 92 percentile range (see photos) and the graphics were very smooth ranging anywhere from high 60's to 130 FPS on ultra settings.As mentioned I am not a PC gamer but hopefully this information will be helpful for those that do partake. I may run some console emulators at some point, but for now I'll just be enjoying the soft glow from the keyboard lighting."

        "What can I say?I was specifically looking for something small, lightweight and with performance that would cover my educational needs, in particular, working with special programs.Overall, I am happy with my choice.Good screen, normal sound. I do not listen to music on the laptop. For this I have good speakers and headphones but if do not nitpick, the sound is really good.This is not my first Asus. My first laptop was more productive and covered 100% of my needs but it was heavier and inconvenient to move. Also, in some places there was play and creaking. There were also light spots on the screen near the frame.This laptop does not have such problems. Nothing creaks, the screen is fine, although it has a different type of matrix but I really like it.It's just a pity that you can't choose a larger amount of RAM.",
        "Overall this laptop is meeting all my expectations. The screen is nice, the keyboard works smoothly, the entire unit feels pretty solid. I’m using it for basic stuff like Microsoft office , web browsing, and streaming.",
        "I got a great deal on this top of the line fully loaded ASUS laptop on sale for $899. The OLED screen is one of the best I’ve ever seen on a laptop, and I’ve been in the IT business for three decades. The brightness and color accuracy would benefit anyone doing video editing or graphic arts. If you’ve never had an OLED tv or monitor you’re in for a treat. Each pixel produces light just like the old plasma monitors. Black is literally black. Colors are vibrant and stunning. HDR video is breathtaking. The laptop is ultra lightweight but sturdy metal construction. It has a high end Intel Core Ultra 9 CPU with 16 GB RAM memory and a huge 1 TB solid state hard drive which means this is a beast capable of running complex operations like virtual machines, video rendering, and AI onboard. I can run two external HD monitors while using the onboard OLED monitor at the same time. It has a micro SD card slot for all you drone pilots, vloggers, photographers, and videographers. Two built in USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports in addition to two old school superspeed powered USB-A ports and an HDMI port. The power supply connects on the side through one of the USB-C ports, so in my setup at home I use a powered USB-C hub to connect the external monitors and other peripherals. Plenty of inexpensive portable USB-C hubs are on Amazon for travel purposes. This laptop is so lightweight that you won’t hesitate to take it with you. The keyboard has good action for an ultra portable, and you can control the backlight colors. I have big hands and have no trouble typing on this excellent keyboard. The trackpad is excellent, although I tend to use a wireless mouse when at home and when traveling. The only criticism I have of this laptop is the heat produced and the fan noise when running tasks that shouldn’t be taxing to this modern CPU like web browsing. The dual fans do a good job venting heat through the back but are very loud. I haven’t yet tested how this effects video calls but even if noise cancelling software blocks the sound for the call It will be loud on your end. That is the case on telephone calls and so the fan noise and heat is enough to zonk my rating down to four stars. An M3 CPU MacBook Air costs more but doesn’t have the heat or noise problems."

        "My old Levono laptop is ancient. It dates back Windows 7.  It was time to upgrade.  I like the feel of Levono keyboards, and they to be trouble free for many years.  The new one is very light, the keyboard is familiar, and the battery life is awesome. I find myself carrying this one around the house, on the outdoor deck, and in the basement.  The old PC was heavy and had 1-2 hours battery life.  Other laptops maybe better, but this one was rated highly and has exceeded my expectations. Levono seems to have made the start up process practically painless.  When I the found my passwords were retained it was a true blessing and a big surprise.",

        "My favorite laptop! fast, never lags.  never drops wi-fi or bluetooth signals.  Can and do work on the Microsoft Edge, which was new to me but it works flawlessly.  Back to the computer.. never heats up, charges up quickly, has a decent battery life.  Keyboard is an 8/10.. It feels great and comfortable on the fingers, tactile feel.. Trackpad is pretty good as well.. Took me a while to adapt due to coming from Apple beforehand and was searching for that command key for the longest haha, but the learning curve was fairly simple for me.  Good sound as well.  The display is not the best, but it's good for most people.  Feel as though it could be more vibrant.  Easy to start up and shut down, both are quick.  I like the Lenovo, that  camera blind is a cool feature.  Nice size and comfortable for the around eight hours per work day that I use it.  Go buy it! (no proof-read)",
        "I'm very happy with what I got for less than $700.  Pretty respectable specs, extremely light.  It's a great daily driver to do all my email, word processing, messing around with YouTube, etc...  I haven't tried dev with it yet, but it might even be good enough for lightweight development.One thing I would improve is the mouse pad, although the mouse pad imo hasn't been good on laptops since the very first IBM Think Pad from the mid 1990's which had a little joystick for a mouse, so you could mouse and type at the same time.  I've never seen a mouse pad be very accurate and they're always cumbersome to use.  Since Lenovo bought the Think Pad brand, maybe they could dig that tech up and do a reboot.",
        "fast, but limited by browser javascript overloading the ram cache. this is unavoidable b/c as a software developer, the idiots that make web pages these days overload them with so much garbage they dont run properly. this has nothing to do with the quality of this laptop.now that i'm done venting, let's get to why this machine is great.1. boot time is blazingly fast (<8s to windows screen)2. nice and roomy storage (got 1tb) which is one of the main factors of me buying over mac. (VERY tough choice - but i have an old macbook air for now)3. i needed this machine for development, and like the nice tie in to windows onedrive, really gives me an easy way to manage my file repository.4. keyboard is good but i like beveled keys better (no backlight)5. overall great machine for the money, if you want all the bells and whistles you will be spending > 7-800 clams.  my reccomendation is that if you don't care about touchscreeen, get a macbook air 2024 for $850.6. nice screen size, i don't care about the image quality b/c i'm coding on this thing. its a great price b/c if it breaks, is stolen, etc, i can buy a new one. i would cry sweet tears if the macbook broke.note: this is NOT a gaming machine. if you want to game, get a console, its the best way to go. if you are a pc gamer you need to spend north of 1k to get anything decent.overall, one of the best in its class for barebones with good power. if you want bells and whistles, fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, touchscreen, etc, you'll have to spend more. i went for raw power and storage, with good screensize. it was a very tough choice over mac but i came up as a developer with windows and i'm going back. i like the mac shell but powershell cuts the mustard now.for $500 with windows pro, this is a great developer machine. very happy with it so far.giving it a 4/5.no comment on battery life yet... probably ok."

        "Years ago, I had the original Surface Laptop, and I loved it. It remains one of my favorite laptops of all time.So before I purchased the Surface Laptop 7, I actually had a 14\" 2021 Macbook Pro. It was honestly too much laptop for my needs, but the limited port selection on the Macbook Airs ruled them out for me. Of course, my Macbook Pro was better than the Surface Laptop 7 in many ways - the mini-LED screen is just about the best laptop display you can get, full-stop, whereas the Surface's display is good but not great. The speakers on the Macbook were amazing; the Surface's are quite good but can't compete in that regard.However, I don't regret my purchase for one second because the Surface Laptop 7 is really a Macbook Air competitor, and that is where it shines. I compared the Surface and Macbook Air 13\" side by side and came away with the following conclusions:-Screen: I don't do any serious photo editing or graphic design. To me, the Surface screen is slightly better. It gets much brighter than the Air and colors seem more accurate. However, the Air has better black levels. The Surface is a touchscreen, but I never use it as I don't like fingerprints on my screens. However, if you want a touchscreen, the Surface is clearly the better option. The Surface also has a 120hz display, whereas the Air is stuck at 60hz. The difference in smoothness when scrolling or using trackpad gestures is very noticeable. The Surface's screen looks much smoother.-Speakers: I can't tell the difference between the two. The Surface's speakers are really good compared to other laptops in this class. The same is true of the Macbook Air.-Ports: I had hoped that by 2024, USB-A would be all but gone, but alas it is not. It was very annoying to have to carry around dongles to use USB-A devices on my Macbook Pro, and now I don't have to! The Air has only two USB-C ports, so clearly the Surface wins here. The Macbook Pro does have HDMI, which is nice, but I just bought a USB-C to HDMI cable that I carry around with me, so I don't need a dongle for that either.-Keyboard: I like that the Macbook Air has more than 3 levels of brightness control, but I slightly prefer the key feel on the Surface.- Trackpad: somehow, the Surface's trackpad is better. I am thrilled that Microsoft finally brought a haptic trackpad to the Surface lineup. It feels more delicate and the tactility is stronger. Macbook trackpads are still among the best in the business, but there is finally a Windows laptop that is comparable in this regard.-Login: hands down, Windows Hello is better than the fingerprint reader. It's so fast that my Surface often logs me that it feels like the laptop was left unlocked. The fingerprint scanner on Macbooks are very good, but they are not as fast, nor as convenient, as Windows Hello. My Macbook Pro could also unlock with my Apple Watch, but that almost always took longer than unlocking with my finger.-Build Quality: This has always been a strong point for Surface devices, and the Surface Laptop 7 doesn't disappoint. The laptop can be opened easily with one hand, and the fit and finish is flawless. The same is true of the Macbook Air. I can't say whether one is better than the other. The Surface is designed to be easier to service, however, and you can actually replace the SSD, which is very nice. Additionally, the black finish on my Surface is more resistant to showing fingerprints than the dark blue on the Macbook Airs, which is a fingerprint magnet.-Performance: After owning an Apple Silicon laptop, I could never go back to using an x86/x64 processor. I used Windows 11 for ARM on my Macbook for two years virtualized in Paralells, so I knew what I was getting into. All of the applications I need work beautifully on the Surface, and it is so darn fast. Of course, there are more powerful processors out there using traditional x64 architecture, but I have never used a Windows laptop that is just so snappy for every day tasks. Office apps open in 1-2 seconds. Firefox, Chrome, and Edge open in less than a second. Using gestures to swipe through apps is super snappy, and the high refresh rate screen makes transitions look so smooth. This is the kind of performance I came to except from my Apple Silicon Macbook, and it's wonderful to finally see Windows operating just as responsively.Overall, the Surface feels like an upgrade over my Macbook Pro, and I personally am fine with the tradeoffs that come with the thinner, smaller, and lighter Surface over the more powerful Macbook Pro. It is an utterly fantastic laptop that, in my opinion, is currently the best thin-and-light laptop in the world.",
        "This laptop is very powerful as well as very efficient. I’ve been using it as my main laptop for studying and it lasts nearly the whole day.  It’s fast and zippy. If there’s one thing I don’t like about it, it’s that not all computer programs are compatible with it right now. However, you can download some of those programs from the Microsoft App Store. It’s also smaller than I thought it would be, but the screen is quite big. Sound quality is decent and the screen is nice and sharp. It’s not an oled screen but it’s still very impressive. The keyboard itself is very much the best keyboard I’ve used on a computer.  The track pad is also very good. This laptop is very sturdy and light as well. Copilot is useful and fun to use, but it still needs some work. All in all, for the features and the power this computer has I think it’s a great value for the money, especially when you get it on sale for the holidays!",
        "I recently purchased the Microsoft Surface Laptop (2024), and overall, I’m incredibly impressed with its performance. The 13.8\" touchscreen display is vibrant and crisp, and the Snapdragon X Elite (12-core) processor makes multitasking a breeze. With 16GB of RAM and 1TB SSD storage, this laptop handles everything I throw at it—whether it’s video editing, running complex software, or just casual browsing.  Windows 11 runs smoothly, and the device feels premium and well-built. Battery life is outstanding, and it’s surprisingly lightweight, making it great for both work and travel. The laptop is fast, responsive, and does exactly what I need without any hiccups.  However, my one gripe is that after spending nearly $2,000 on this high-end machine, I still have to pay extra for Copilot+. Given the price of the laptop, I would have expected this feature to be included, especially since it’s one of Windows 11's flagship features. While Copilot+ is a helpful AI tool, it feels like it should be a standard part of the package.  Overall, I’m still giving it 5 stars because the hardware is fantastic, and it excels at everything I use it for. I just wish Microsoft would rethink the pricing model for Copilot+."

        "So far, no problems at all. Very fast and responsive, performing well under some heavy demanding resources apps. The SSD capacity it's a plus, processor and RAM mid-range to top. Overall, it's a good laptop, battery life good under normal/standard use, sturdy built, very lightweight and portable, nice full keyboard, and definitely you'll get your work done with some style.",
        "My daughter's laptop \"died\" - she liked this one of all she investigated - so mamma purchased it for her.  She loves it.  Does everything she needs for a great price!!!!",
        "6 months into this laptop and so far it’s been bulletproof. I’m had on computers as I do a lot of coding (Rust & Python).  I needed a lot of memory for big datasets 1m rows is not uncommon for one of my projects. This laptop handles it very well.  Would have liked it if it was a touchscreen but such is the computer market."

        "I recently purchased the 2024 ASUS VivoBook, and I couldn't be more pleased with my choice! From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek and modern design caught my eye. The build quality is exceptional, combining lightweight portability with a robust feel.The performance has been outstanding, thanks to the latest Intel Core processor and ample RAM. It handles multitasking effortlessly, and I've experienced zero lag, even when running multiple applications simultaneously. The SSD provides lightning-fast boot times and quick access to my files, enhancing overall productivity.The display is vibrant and crisp, perfect for both work and leisure. The colors are rich, and the resolution makes everything look sharp and clear. I especially appreciate the thin bezels, which make the screen feel even more expansive.The keyboard is a joy to type on, with comfortable, well-spaced keys that make long typing sessions a breeze. The backlighting is a nice touch for working in dim environments. The touchpad is responsive and supports various gestures, adding to the ease of navigation.Battery life is another highlight. On a full charge, I can get through an entire workday without reaching for the charger. This kind of endurance is fantastic for someone constantly on the go.Connectivity options are plentiful, with a variety of ports that accommodate all my peripheral needs. The inclusion of USB-C is a significant plus, offering fast data transfer and charging capabilities.Overall, the 2024 ASUS VivoBook delivers in every aspect, making it an excellent choice for both professionals",
        "I bought this for my husband who was always complaining about his slow laptop. This one is very fast and opens quickly.I shopped for this with the help of 2 IT friends who guided me to this laptop. They came over to set it up for my husband and were both amazed at how large the screen is and how quickly it responds.I think this was a great choice and my husband is loving it!",
        "DOA. Would not charge. Would not turn on. Amazons option is to return for refund. Asus wants me to send it to them for 3-6 weeks for repair at my shipping expense. The laptop looks nice and is lightweight. But is completely unusable and no support given by anyone. Will be switching to a different brand."

        "**NOT AGAINST ANY OTHER STARTER OR ADVANCED WHEEL BRANDS/MODELS, OR OTHER USER OPINIONS OF SAME OR OTHER PRODUCTS.**-LOVE IT.... in my opinion......the Logitech G920 is hands down AMAZING for myself being a first time wheel user (switching from controller). I Play on PC, and the game I first tried using the G920 was F1 2021. It took less than 30 minutes to position the pedals on my office carpet/ mounting the wheel to my desk and connecting cables. The SOFTWARE (Logitech G-Hub) for the G920 is very nice and simple for initially setting up your overall configurations for the wheel and throttle/brake/clutch pedals. It took me maybe 2-3 hours across about only 2-3 days to get used to my settings/feedback/calibration preferences, which was WAY quicker than I thought it would take. VERY CLEAN and responsive dual-motor force feedback. EVEN without setting the feedback strength to 100% in game yet it performs amazing. The G920 works likewise on iRacing as well! **BRAKE FOOT PETAL IS VERY FIRM AND THAT WAS MY ONLY INITIAL CONCERN FROM REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THE G920......HOWEVER!!!  LIKE MANY OTHERS HAVE DONE, I SIMPLY AND GLADLY CHANGED THE BRAKE BINDING TO THE CLUTCH PEDAL CONSIDERING THAT IN F1 GAMES, THE CLUTCH IS ONLY USED FOR RACE STARTS/LAUNCHES AND IS NOT USED OR NEEDED FOR MANUAL PADDLE SHIFTING, (Bind set up works for holding the clutch while waiting for lights to go out to launch/start a race followed then by using the same pedal (clutch) for any braking done in game).- OVERALL.......THE G920 PERFORMS ABOVE MY EXPECTATIONS. I LOVE THE BUILD QUALITY OF THE WHEEL MATERIAL/FEELING/RESPONSE/ETC.....ALSO THE G920 DOES NOT HAVE A CHEAP FEELING AT ALL. THE QUALITY IS SUPERIOR FOR THE PRICE!!.... I PERSONALLY RECOMMEND THE G920 FOR ANYONE MAKING THE TRANSITION FROM CONTROLLER TO A WHEEL/PEDAL SET UP.  🏁🏁🏁🏁*THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON PERSONAL OPINION WITH PLENTYOF RESEARCH DONE BEFORE PURCHASING.*",
        "I never liked trying to play a racing game with the standard Xbox controller, but I put up with it for years, not wanting to spend the money on a wheel. Well, I finally took the plunge and after first buying the wrong one (the PS version) I got this one when it was on sale around Christmas.At first, I made a crude stand for it using two plastic sawhorses and 3/4\" plywood. It worked ok, but wasn't ideal. Plus, we were finishing the room it was in and that setup wasn't going to fly. So, I bought an adjustable wheel stand. The G920 mounted to it pretty easily and it's stable enough to handle the most aggressive driving.As for the G920 itself, it's been great. I did learn quickly that you have to adjust it within the games or it can be more difficult to handle than the controller. I had constant oversteer in corners of Forza Horizon games until I looked up some tips on what input variables to adjust. Now, it works great. I've ordered the shifter. I know that manual shifting is dying out in real vehicles, but I still enjoy it and look forward to that addition in the near future. My only complaint is that  the USB cable isn't long enough. In my setup, it's hanging in the air when the wheel stand is in its position and its plugged into the Xbox. I guess I can get an extender, but haven't done so yet.The wheel and pedals are pretty well made and feel fairly solid. The paddle shifters work well and the force feedback is pretty strong. It has taken some adjustment on my part as when I used the standard controller, I accepted that it was a video game and wouldn't feel like driving a real car or truck. With the wheel, I kind of expected it to feel EXACTLY like a real car, but there is a bit of numbness--even though the wheel tries to transmit some road feel.As this is the only wheel/pedal setup I've ever used, I can't compare it to others, but I've been extremely happy with it so far and the addition of the shifter is sure to make it even more enjoyable.",
        "Not even pressing on the pedals and it shows full input on all 3 pedals. Doesn't change if I use them.Playing any racing game the accelerator and clutch pedal are combined. Sometimes the accelerator will go up to 30-50% and I have to press the clutch to reach 100% as if they were combined eventho that box remains unchecked. I let it go a few months hoping it was driver related, constantly Uninstalling and reinstalling different drivers but nothing has changes.Worse experience I've had in a LONG time. Waste of money. I hope I can get warranties or my money back. So frustrating, so disappointing.***Update***After some rough customer service via web chat and trying to warranty the product and waited for the warranty email I had never received, I was sure it was a hardware defect and not a software defect.I found a pinch in the main wire whip right by the pedal assembly.  After rewiring the 5 wires with solder+water proof heatshrink, the pedals worked phenomenally!!!I do like logitec but it seems like their QC has gone south quite a bit. I had a $100 keyboard that lasted just passed the warranty as well as a g502 hero Special Edition mouse. I went back to my worn OG-502 and no other mouse compares...So about the setup... Finally aving some seat time on the PC with the G920 wheel, pedals, and 6 speed shifter with the addition of a USB handbrake..... the experience is u parallel.. it work from Forza to spin tires, it work with every driving game. If you like racing games or sims and don't want to drop over 1k for an indoor pass time or hobby but get great force feedback and a unique feel to every pedal. Then definitely gamble and get one of these logitecs. If you have a few extra bills to blow, get something better and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.***Update, a month or so after this review I found a fault in the wiring, I cut out the bad section and spliced the wires back together,  works great, great product. I bought my friend one as a gift after I fixed my own.***I would buy again. But I already did :)"

        "Overall the build quality is solid, nothing seems too cheap or flimsy, it’s easy to use and set up and works well with assetto corsa, forza 5, and race room. The mounting system is well designed, it’s secure but easy to uninstall if you want to move it. but if it’s trying to be the same as a car it needs some work, the clutch pedal feels almost the same as the gas and with how good the brake feels I was expecting a bit better, the paddle shifters are way too mushy it should be a bit or resistance with a nice click of the whole paddle not a linear motion with a mouse button click at the end, the wheel itself is also tiny it’s smaller than the ones that come on the new civics, though that was probably a compromise to save space. I really can’t complain much because it wasn’t that expensive the feedback feels nice it looks nice it works well and it doesn’t feel like it’s gonna fall apart any time soon I’ve just been spoiled by driving real cars so I know how these things should feel, and having such a stark difference in the components makes it feel more like a toy than I would’ve liked, but I’m not complaining I’m just trying to be descriptive it’s a great product with Logitechs great quality I also appreciate the amount of metal used as far as I can tell the only plastic is the outer casing and the buttons and that plastic feels really good too, they clearly put the money where they needed to with this product.",
        "The **Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel and Floor Pedals** is an impressive piece of gear for both casual and serious racing gamers. As a long-time racing sim enthusiast, I appreciate the attention to detail Logitech put into this wheel.**Strong Points:**- **Force Feedback:** The dual-motor force feedback is incredibly responsive, offering a realistic driving experience. You can feel every bump, skid, and weight transfer as if you're behind the wheel of a real car.- **Build Quality:** The wheel is wrapped in high-quality leather, which adds a premium feel, and the steel ball bearings ensure durability over extended use. The pedals, with stainless steel components, are sturdy and well-built.- **Pedals:** The inclusion of a clutch pedal is a huge plus for manual driving fans. The brake pedal offers progressive resistance, simulating real-life braking pressure, which adds to the immersion.- **Compatibility:** It's compatible with both PC and PlayStation consoles (PS3 and PS4), so it's versatile across platforms.**Weak Points:**- **Shifter Sold Separately:** The lack of an included gear shifter is a downside for those who want the full manual driving experience. Purchasing the Logitech G Driving Force Shifter separately adds to the cost.- **Pedal Adjustability:** While the pedals feel great, there’s limited adjustability in terms of positioning and pressure. Customization options would make the set more adaptable to different preferences and setups.- **Clutch Sensitivity:** Some users may find that the clutch doesn’t always feel as responsive as it should, particularly in highly competitive racing sims where precision is key.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the **Logitech G29** delivers an immersive and realistic racing experience, with excellent force feedback and build quality. While the lack of an included shifter and minor pedal adjustments could be improved, it remains a solid choice for both beginners and seasoned sim racers.",
        "Purchased this for American Truck Simulator on PC.  Never owned a wheel before, but I am finding this to be absolutely worth it for what I bought it for.  Build quality is good.  Clamps do feel kind of cheap, but get the job done without issue.  Wheel and pedals themselves feel great.  Has plenty of buttons for custom configurations.  Was extremely easy to set up and connect.  I really have little negative to say about this product.  You cant do custom bindings for the pedals through logitech's software which is kind of annoying (wouldve been cool to remap the clutch pedal to an ebrake or something when driving automatics for example) and the clamps dont fit thicker desks - although 3rd party solutions exist.  Its fine how it is though and works as intended.  Cant speak on how the product performs in other kinds of driving games, but I would guess its still a step above gamepads.  This product is a fantasitic mix of quality, features, price point, and ease of use.  Im finding this to be a nice starter wheel so far that checks all boxes, and would reccomend the shifter that goes with it if youve already bought this wheel, are enjoying it, and looking for extra ways to enhance your simulated driving experience."

        "Works well for the office. It's pretty soft and lightweight so easy to move if needed.",
        "My legs swell when not raised up, even for short periods.  I use this in the front passenger side to get my legs up a bit, and it helps my knee pain, too. It's very comfortable, I slip my shoes off and it's soft enough yet firm enough for support.  It's a convenient size, I can still have my portable oxygen compressor and my purse by my feet, although no room for much else, except my cane.  The bottom piece can be removed (Velcro) if you want it lower, though I will not do that.  A reasonable price, too, compared to many similar ones.  I would definitely buy another when I need it."

        "These lights are simple and very easy to use. They can lay down or stand up depending on your desired setup. Very bright for their intended use. Nothing complicated and they work. Just like they should. Good job team! Keep it up!",
        "My son has been using these for a while and hasn’t had any issues. Nice cheap little desk lights.",
        "Usually I try to stay away from buying something just because it's cheap. While these lights won't fill the room with light, as an accent light they're actually not bad. I like that I don't have to plug them into my computer to use them. Just plugged them into my surge protector and they work just fine. The brightness leaves something to be desired and they feel like cheap plastic, but that's kinda expected for the price you're paying. You're definitely not gonna get the same brightness, quality or effects from an more expensive brand or bigger system, but if you're just looking for small accent lighting this will do fine. I wish the cords were a big longer as you're definitely limited to wherever you can plug it into. The connection is a Y cable, with about 6 inches from the USB to where it branches apart to each light bar and about *maybe* 2 feet of cable. So yeah, you don't get much room to play around with placement.The functions are the standard ones everyone seems to use, though I think they're labeled wrong. For example \"Strobe\" smoothly switches between colors but \"Smooth\" literally does the exact same thing as \"Fade\", with each color weirdly being shown twice (ie., it dims to a new color, dims again, then shows that exact same color again, then dims and brings up a new color). \"Flash\" is straight up seizure inducing. Thankfully I don't use the functions and keep it on a single color.The controller works good and doesn't feel like it'll break when you push the buttons, which is definitely a welcome change as remotes for cheap LEDs are usually totally busted.I haven't tried the music feature and have no plans on ever using it for that.All in all for the price and as long as you keep your expectations low, you'll be happy with this. It's not gonna knock it out the park for sub-twenty bucks but it does everything it advertises, which is much better than many other RGB LED products."

        "Bought this for a birthday gift for my 12 year oldSon and he thought it was the coolest thing !! He is a call of duty fanatic. You definitely get your moneys worth . It is built sturdy and it’s a decent size !! I thought it was going to be small but it’s not. It also has some weight to it so when u put an electronic on it it DOES NOT TIP OVER ! It worth the price !! I will be ordering another one for my husband now because he liked the monkey bomb and the quality of it",

        "The Logitech G305 Wireless Mouse is a solid option for those seeking a lightweight and easy-to-use mouse. It fits comfortably in my hand, though those with larger hands might find it on the smaller side. The mouse connects reliably with the USB sensor—I've had zero issues with connectivity.Setting up was a breeze with Logitech's G-Hub software, which made it easy to adjust settings to my preferences. As a bonus, the G-Hub instantly recognized my Logitech video camera, allowing me to manage settings for both devices seamlessly.The G305 offers impressive performance, especially for its price. It’s capable of doing more than I currently need, but that leaves room for it to adapt to various tasks as needed. I haven’t used it for too long yet, but so far, it’s been fantastic—highly recommend it for anyone in the market for a high-quality, budget-friendly wireless mouse.",
        "The Logitech G305 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse has quickly become my go-to for both gaming and everyday use. I was initially skeptical about wireless performance, but this mouse has completely blown me away with its 1ms report rate.One of my favorite aspects is the compact, lightweight design, it feels comfortable in my hand, and despite being lightweight, it’s durable and well-built. The battery life is phenomenal as well, with up to 250 hours of continuous gaming on a single AA battery, meaning I don’t have to worry about frequent charging or battery swaps.Overall, if you’re looking for a wireless gaming mouse that combines performance, precision, the Logitech G305 is an excellent choice. Highly recommend it for any gamer!",
        "My old mouse died on me, the buttons stopped engaging and I couldn't keep up with my gaming.But this is just perfect!Three speed options, forward/backward buttons, usb-c port and wireless. It matches my headphones perfectly too! I'm not a professional gamer but this mouse is a really good starting point. It's simple and comfortably sits in your hand, left or right.I can't recommend this mouse enough!"

        "I bought the Logitech G Driving Force Shifter for my teenage son, and it’s been a fantastic addition to his gaming experience. The shifter is solidly built with a premium feel, featuring a smooth six-speed H-pattern that closely mimics real-life gear shifting. It’s easy to set up and works seamlessly with his racing wheel and pedals, adding a new level of immersion to his racing games. The materials feel durable, and even after extensive use, it’s held up without any signs of wear. My son particularly enjoys the precision and responsiveness during gameplay, and it's compatible with both PC and consoles. A great choice for anyone wanting to enhance their racing simulation experience!",
        "Got this for my g29.  Product does not dissapoint.  Works well, has good build quality, and feels great.  I really wish it had a couple buttons/switches built in - wouldve been nice for games with split gears - but its fine as it is.  Only real issue I have with it is I can feel the cheap plastic cap they stuck on the knob move around very slightly sometimes.  Doesnt affect performace at all, but is just a minor annoyance at times.  Overall a great purchase if you own a logitech compatible wheel already.",

        "I recently purchased the Compressed Air Duster, and it has become an indispensable tool in my cleaning routine. This cordless electric air duster boasts three gears, offering impressive power ranging from 3,000 to a whopping 51,000 RPM. Here's my comprehensive review of this handy gadget.Performance: 5/5The Compressed Air Duster's performance exceeded my expectations. The three gear options allow for versatile usage, whether you need a gentle dusting or a powerful blast to tackle stubborn debris. The 51,000 RPM capability ensures that no dust or dirt stands a chance.Usability: 4.5/5The cordless design adds a level of convenience to my cleaning sessions. No more searching for power outlets or dealing with tangled cords. The device is lightweight and easy to handle, making it suitable for various tasks. However, I deducted half a point as the trigger could be a bit sensitive, requiring a gentle touch to control the airflow precisely.Battery Life: 4/5Equipped with a 6000mAh rechargeable battery, the Compressed Air Duster offers decent battery life. I was able to use it for an extended period before needing a recharge. It would be ideal if the battery life were a bit longer, especially for users with extensive cleaning needs.Build Quality: 4.5/5The device feels sturdy and well-built. The materials used are of high quality, ensuring durability. The sleek design adds a modern touch, and the overall construction gives a sense of reliability. I appreciate the attention to detail in the design.Rechargeable Feature: 5/5The rechargeable feature is a game-changer. No more wasting money on disposable air cans. The 6000mAh battery holds up well, and the recharging process is quick and efficient. This environmentally friendly aspect is a significant advantage.In conclusion, the Compressed Air Duster is a fantastic addition to any cleaning arsenal. Its powerful performance, cordless design, and rechargeable feature make it a standout choice. While there's room for slight improvement in sensitivity and battery life, overall, it's a reliable and efficient tool for keeping your electronics and workspaces dust-free. I highly recommend it!",
        "I use this product everywhere I used canned air before, and it works perfectly well.  I do miss the immediate blast that consumable canned air would provide, as the fans must briefly build up the momentum to reach the same force.  The attachments work well with pretty much any application you’d think to use a duster.",
        "The air pressure is decent enough to dislodge keyboard dust. It’s easy to use and compact. The attachments it comes with are nice but I didn’t have any use for them.The only issue is it’s a little noisy. I wouldn’t say it’s so loud that it’s annoying to use, but it would definitely be annoying to other people around you in like an office or public setting."

        "First, I think the lights are great overall. Has multiple colors, and the app that you can download is good. Remote works great and the lights look great behind the tv and reduces eye strain in a darker environment. Really enhances the experience.Now a few suggestions: installing the lights was relatively easy but I would suggest to look up ways to make a loop at the corners for the instructions don't really do a lot for that. There are multiple you tube videos I watched to make it better.Lastly, I have a Toshiba tv and even when I turned the lights off and the tv off, the lights would turn off, but turned on automatically multiple times in a few minutes. I tried changing settings but could not find anything to alter this. So what I did is purchase a USB on/off extension switch on Amazon, hooked it to the bottom of the tv (mounted tv up higher) with a command strip,and it worked great. Now when I want the lights on I can flip the switch easily and then just flip it again when I get done watching. Not amazingly convenient for everyone probably, but definitely reduced the  frustration of lights coming in for no reason.Overall, the lights are great, look great, and enhance the experience of watching TV in a darker environment.",
        "These lights are super easy to install and control. They’re easily dimmed. The app is simple to use. It looks great when the lights are on and doesn’t detract from my TV. I’m very glad that I don’t have to worry about excess cords going everywhere.",
        "If you’re looking for fast installation, with no fuss, can’t go wrong with these. Basic rgb modes but they’re so inexpensive. Have been working good on my monitor, adhesive seems decent. Just clean your mounting surface with some alcohol wipes, should be good."

It’s a great addition to a gaming area my son has it next to his cpu in conjunction with light bars, rgb headphones and rgb gaming chair to increase his gaming experience and just loves it and  loves taking our sodas to put in his mini fridge lol we’ll worth the money and if your in the market for a mini fridge I highly suggest buying this one asap before it sells out or the price goes up.",
        "This has to be one of the worst purchases ever.  Bought one and I bought it open box.  There are times I’ve ordered something. I realize it doesn’t fit or match or I don’t like it and returned it in brand new condition.  When I saw the fridge open box for half off, I thought cool.  Someone got it it didn’t work for their space and they returned it.  I trusted that Amazon did their due diligence.Package arrives.  Open it plug it in.  It worked for 5 seconds and then the lights turned white.  No color.  That was it.OK, I figured well that was an open box fail.  So I returned it purchased a new one.Opened the box to the new one. Plugged it in.  It lit up.  Great.Keep in mind this is for a seven-year-old so I wasn’t expecting anything fancyHowever, this thing is such a piece of junkYou have to use two hands to close it  Literally.  You have to hold the back while you shut the door.It has no temp control.  So it goes from barely cooling to forming icicles and freezer burn around the back of the fridge.It’s LOUD.  It sounds like you’re inflating an air mattress.  The only way to make it shut up is to unplug it.  Then it doesn’t actually work as a fridge.Whatever.  The little one sleeps on a loft bunk so the noise didn’t bother him.  When I would tuck him in, I would have to unplug it because I couldn’t take the noise then I would just plug it in before I left the room.Then after 10 days it stopped working entirely.No LED lights.  No cooling.However, the noise never stopped.  No lights.  No cooling.  Just soundSo it’s just basically a very cheaply made noise machine that sounds like your blowing up inflatables with an air machine.Honestly, honestly, I can’t imagine spending more than five dollars on this and using it for an evening and throwing it away.I can’t believe this is made by Frigidaire.  It’s such a horribly made product.It’s just junk.  Dollhouse furniture is constructed better.You can’t use this for anything besides a power hog and noise.  According to my smart plug it used massive power. lol. For what??Honestly.  Do. Not. Buy.  Next.You’re welcome."

        "I was a little on the fence about getting this, but It honestly really awesome. The led lights are really nice, and you have a handful of options to choose from. The wireless charging is the cherry on top, and perfect for student gamers. I can leave my phone to charge while gaming or doing homework, so I don’t really worry about it randomly dying anymore. It’s a little slow charging, but most wireless charging isn’t all that fast. Overall, awesome investment for practicality and gaming aesthetic!",
        "Mouse responds well with pad. Feels comfortable working on it all day. Charging function works with my Galaxy Z-fold even with the case in it. It does not charge my Galaxy watch though.

        "This controller and headset stand is super easy to setup and works immediately after plugging into your PC. The colors are a bit weaker than I had thought they would be, but it still looks very nice. The stand itself is sturdy and comes with four controller pegs, but I only needed two so I  have extra. It fits my headset and controller perfectly and there is a anti-slip cover on the tops of the pegs so your controller won't slip off. Phone charger also works with this, but your PC may try to pick it up as a new audio device or something, so just decline it if that notification pops up.

        "So I originally just bought this item as a way to get free overnight shipping. Little did I know that this would become my go-to cleaning method for my yearly cleaning of my collectibles. I have A LOT of collectibles displayed in my room. Statues, amiibos, replicas, you name it. So much in fact, that it normally takes me at least a full 24 hours to dust off everything. With this item, which I’ve nicknamed “The Blob” (for obvious reasons), I’ve managed to cut my dusting time in half. The item is very easy to use and extremely effective. You just grab a small amount and mold it into/around your chosen object. It’s extremely versatile, capable of molding into whatever shape you desire. This allows it to easily remove dust from hard to reach places, like corners and small crevasses. As a bonus, it’s very cheap and comes in a small, portable, plastic jar with a screw on lid. You can toss the jar into a toolbox, drawer, glovebox, or even place it on a desk for easy access. The best part about it is that there’s no mess. There’s no sticky residue on your items or skin. No dust flying through the air or on the floor. It’s simply a cheap, effective, and easy to use product. What more can you ask for?",
        "This works great on everything I tried this cleaner on however, I never found it that useful on my keyboard. For those who have mechanical keyboards with the top part of the switch exposed, don't get it as the hair and dust will not get cleaned unless you are risking getting the slime stuck in the switches. Somehow this product got better over time as it dried out too making this a really odd cleaner. This product is good for non-keyboard cleaning.  A month or two ago, I got this cleaner to clean my dirty keyboard and possibly my computer. when the product arrived, it didn't work well, well, for the first few days. It was too wet to stick to most things and could only stick to things if you left it on there for quite a long time. I was about to throw it away until I decided to try it one more time and somehow it worked! It could pick up dust and hair with ease now. This was great as my dogs and cats shed quite alot but there was one flaw. the debris got stuck around my keyboard switches and couldn't be removed with the cleaner. I didn't want to risk destroying my keyboard either with it so I decided to only use it for cleaning other things such as my keyboard and desk. So this is really an odd product in my opinion.",
        "I have a primary small keyboard vacuum that I use to remove 99% of the dust and small particles. This gel should handle all that itself, but used in conjunction makes this last incredibly long. It gives you a keyboard that looks 100% new, very impressive.I was able to restore a 5yr old Razer keyboard (in my spare bin) that was originally $180. With the vacuum and a thing of this gel, completely restored it to like-new condition. I should have taken before/after photos."

        "There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!1) Daily useNot everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros: - Fits incredibly well around your hand - Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use  > Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc. - Great grip - Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software2) GamingWhen I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros: - You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better! - The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something) - The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!*** Update ***The mouse is durable  and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself.",
        "I had originally purchased the logitech G502 X wired mouse as it's supposed to be an updated version of the G502 HERO. I was not impressed with G502 X. All the supposed upgrades from the G502 HERO were a let down. The G502 HERO is much better in every way. The side buttons are positioned correctly. The additional 2 top buttons on the left main button are minimal and well placed. I prefer a solid mouse with some heft to it, out of the box the build quality feels great and the additional weights are nice to have.In comparison the G502 X felt cheap, and was too light for my tastes. The side buttons were moved too far back making it awkward to hit the back button. The size of the 2 additional top buttons on the main left button were increased, which made it very easy to accidentally press them while gaming.If you are comparing the two mice I hope this helps. There is a reason why the G502 HERO has as many reviews as it does.",
        "This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."

        "Wow! What a fabulous Microphone!  I did download the noise cancelling software from their website and have it set to 40. It sounds very crisp and clear. I'm shocked for the price range of this mic! VERY happy I got the arm. Still deciding the best place for it. ^^; The hubby really likes how professional looking it is too. Truly Fantastic Microphone for the price. 100% should get the arm. If you've been on the fence about it, don't be. I've gone through several mics and reviews. I have an extremely high-pitched voice that usually cracks/cuts out or makes microphones sound robotic. This doesn't do any of that! My friends also noticed how there isn't any background noise with the noise cancelling on which is awesome! Only downside I would say is I wish I could get the RGB to be the blue/purple/pink breathing gradient. Anyways. Great quality!",
        "I needed a microphone so I can chat in game since I already had a a great headset. This one had positive reviews & looked cool so I bought it. Setup was easy & my pc detected it immediately. Works great with no issues. Wish I knew the difference between condenser vs dynamic beforehand though. Sound quality is great for my needs no complaints for anyone listening.",
        "I got these to replace a Blue Yeti microphone.  Before you jump on me for replacing a $200 microphone with a $40 microphone, hear me out.  The Blue Yeti microphone IS high quality.  It also IS manufactured very well from actual heavy metal.  But, for my purposes, those were actually drawbacks.  The one that I bought two years ago was knocked over several times.  My fault, yes, but the Blue Yeti is not very ergonomic.  Also, yes, I could have mounted it onto an arm, as shown in many pictures, but people don't realize that the Blue Yeti has the same approximate density as a refrigerator.After knocking over the Blue Yeti too many times, the jacks became loose, to the point where both the USB and 3.5 were just falling out.  By the way, I also think it's a poor engineering design to have those hanging from the bottom.  Just saying.This microphone, though, is light.  It is about the size and weight of one of those miniature 8 ounce soda cans.  It fits firmly onto the included spring-arm, and the spring-arm fits firmly onto the edge of a typical desk or table.  The arm is long enough, and has enough tension, that you can position it almost in any position (even having the microphone upsidedown) and it will stay in that position.The microphone itself is plastic, and comes with a sound dampener.  The cable that comes with it is plenty long enough, and of a good and thick quality.  I plugged it in, and it immediately installed itself.  Once I had the arm secured, and the microphone positioned correctly, I was using it immediately.  I jumped into a chat room to have the others there help me with my volume level, and it seemed that having everything set to right in the middle was perfect enough.  I asked repeatedly for them to critique my volume and quality, and they said that it was good.The headphone jack is on the front.  The way that the microphone and arm are manufactured, there are ample places to wrap or feed cables through and around the whole unit, for cable management.  Everything about this microphone is actually off of my desk.  I use average Behringer headphones, and I noticed that there seemed to actually be a slight increase in sound quality through my headphones with this microphone versus the Blue Yeti that I replaced it with.Overall good.  I am giving it four stars only because a very picky person might complain that the microphone is smaller than they thought it would be, or that it is made of plastic.  For me, though, those are both benefits."

        "I like everything about this product.  Heavy duty not flimsy. I especially like the notch for the handle to fit in. Very good product...",
        "If you think over 22 bucks is too much to spend for a cup holder, think again.  I bought this, because I have some kittens in the house that were jumping on my end table and knocking over my glass.  Luckily, it was empty when it happened, but there was an accident just waiting to happen.  I looked at several products before choosing the deep version of this cup holder.  There are cheaper options available, but I wanted a quality product that would last a long time.  This cup holder fits the bill.  It's well made and versatile.  It's solid metal.  There’s textured rubber padding on the bottom of the cup holder, both on the inside and outside.  It’s also around the inside rim and on both sides of the clamp that pinch together.  The clamp is high quality.  The cup holder can separate from the clamp which is convenient for emptying out condensation and cleaning.  It can be adjusted to 5 different positions to accommodate a mug handle.  The paint is powder coated for durability.  So, if you want a product that is going to be useful for many years, this is it.  Or, you can buy one of the many plastic options for around half the price and then it ends up broken and in the trash within a couple of years.  Take your pick.",
        "I like the sturdy feel of metal for my heavy cups and mugs. This one is big enough to hold my largest ceramic mug, and the ability to rotate the holder so the mug handle is at a convenient angle is a definite advantage over other designs. If you have friends or family members who drink tea or coffee all the time, this would make a nice gift."

The rubber is just rigid enough to make this a robust product but still soft enough that it doesn't take a ton of effort to get the cables into position.  You can pull cables through to adjust lengths as desired too.  The adhesive works really well.",
        "These cord organizers are great. They come in three different lengths. They stick to any surface and keep cord where it’s meant to be.Hubby is bedbound and his charger cord drops to floor constantly. He can’t get it. So I bought these.They are perfect. I adhered one to his bedside tray table and it’s just what he needed.I will also put one on his wheelchair as he can charge his phone on it but needs this strip to hold cord so it won’t hang downI will also use one on edge of my desk for my charger cord too.Can be put anywhere though.Highly recommend!",
        "Overall these help keep the top, and bottom, of my desk un cluttered. They stick to my desk and in the year ive had them none have come off. There is one downfall of these though. If you have a larger cable, like some hdmi cables, it may be difficult or impossible for it to clip in. I was able to force my hdmi cable into it but definitely took some difficult work. Overall I would recommend and that con is not enough to make me not buy another."

        "Great controller, works amazing. I trust these from the official Xbox store rather than aftermarket ones. I needed a new one, and these are very fairly priced. It operates perfectly and the smoothness and responsiveness is just as I had hoped. Connected easily to my Xbox One X, vibration is just right. It came with AA batteries, not the battery pack which is separate, but I knew this when buying it. I highly recommend buying a controller like this from the actual Xbox store, and the color is awesome!",
        "The “core” controller is the latest iteration of the xbox controller and from a quick glance it can be difficult to spot a difference from the xbox one controller but there are some subtle ones.The core controller now sports a textile grip texture at the rear of the controller and at the top of the LT and RT triggers. I have never had an issue with slippage on my previous xbox one controller but the texture is a welcome addition and it is very subtle which didn’t cause any discomfort in my hands. The Dpad now sports a similar look to the old 360 design but despite this it thankfully works like a regular Dpad and seems to be much more “clicky” now. It’s responsive and will work fine on platformers and similar style games though it would not be my first preference for fighting games. The only other addition I could spot is the share button which I understand is to capture games clips and screens. The analog sticks feel the same to me and the controller still requires double AA batteries although a battery pack can be purchased separately.Annoyingly, unlike my previous xbox controllers I was not able to get this working via Bluetooth on Ubuntu but connection through USB works with no issues so I just use it like that. I have tested it on a Windows 11 machine and the Bluetooth connection works as expected. Just make sure to select the section under Bluetooth devices that specifically mentions xbox controllers.The version I purchased was the electric volt that sports a two tone colour variant with a Kermit style green at the front and plain white at the back. Initially I thought that white would have quickly become dirty but after a few months of usage this was thankfully not the case. The grip texture strangely does not collect grime buildup which is much appreciated although I wonder what sorcery did they conjure to make this possible?Even if you are primarily a mouse and keyboard player it’s always handy to have a controller in the event you stumble across a game that demands it and I don’t think you can go wrong with this controller which can be had for <50 dollars on sale. I think it’s a perfect pickup if you need a new controller or replacement BUT If you already have a working xbox one controller I don’t think it’s worth spending money for this as an “upgrade” unless of course you really need that share button functionality. Personally, I think the PS5 controller wins the competition this round with newer tech like haptic and audio feedback for games that support it and that support does seem to be growing but that controller is substantially more expensive. You can’t go wrong with either but the core controller is in a much more affordable position particularly at sales prices.",
        "The Electric Volt lime green really pops when you look at it! Haven't seen one this color before and to look at it on screen compared to in person? The images do not do it justice! The color is really vibrant!It came in the brand new Xbox packaging, Microsoft branding, setup manual and warranty/instructions manual and 2 Duracell alkaline batteries. Everything in the box is original and not copied from original. So, I say this controller is LEGIT!It has the USB-C charger port/data plug in the front. Nicely done! The underside of this controller has a textured grip to it which gives this controller much more comfortable feel compared to the older, smooth controllers. The sticks are snappy and precise and the buttons have a much stiffer feel to them as apposed to the older controllers as well.5 Stars and highly recommended!"

        "The Elgato Stream Deck Mini is a compact and powerful tool that revolutionizes content creation for streamers, video editors, and creative enthusiasts alike. Despite its smaller size compared to the standard Stream Deck, this mini version proves to be a game-changer with its intuitive design and seamless integration with various applications.First and foremost, the Stream Deck Mini's key feature is its six customizable LCD keys, each displaying icons of your choice. The key configurations are a breeze to set up using the user-friendly Stream Deck software, which allows you to assign a wide range of actions, hotkeys, and macros to the keys. From launching applications and switching scenes to triggering sound effects and social media commands, the possibilities are virtually limitless.The compact form factor of the Stream Deck Mini is a major advantage, as it easily fits into any workspace without occupying much real estate. Its portability makes it ideal for content creators who are always on the move or have limited desk space. Despite its smaller size, the keys remain responsive and provide satisfying tactile feedback, ensuring quick and precise actions with every press.The integration with popular software and streaming platforms is seamless, making the Stream Deck Mini an indispensable companion for streamers. Whether you're using OBS Studio, Streamlabs, or even Adobe applications like Photoshop and Premiere Pro, the Stream Deck Mini significantly streamlines your workflow and enhances productivity.In addition to its practicality for live streaming, the Stream Deck Mini is also an asset for video editing enthusiasts. Customizing keys with various editing commands and shortcuts expedites the editing process, saving valuable time and effort.One minor aspect to consider is the limitation of six keys, which may be insufficient for users with a wide array of commands and actions to manage. However, for those who don't require an extensive number of buttons or prefer a minimalistic setup, the Stream Deck Mini offers the perfect balance of functionality and simplicity.In conclusion, the Elgato Stream Deck Mini is a must-have tool for streamers, content creators, and video editors seeking to optimize their workflow and take their production quality to the next level. Its compact size, user-friendly software, and seamless integration with various applications make it a standout product in its category. If you're looking to enhance your content creation process and gain more control over your tasks, the Stream Deck Mini is an investment that will undoubtedly pay off.",
        "I got the mini one because this is my first Stream Deck and I didn't have the budget for the bigger ones. The six buttons I've programed are: 1) switch between main monitors 2) show/hide desktop icons 3) switch between speakers and headphones 4) increase volume 5) decrease volume 6) mute.Being able to do all of these commands with the push of a button is amazing. Next week I'm going to add a folder with some multi-action commands to use for work. The possibilities are almost endless. I purchased a few icon packs from the elgato store and there are a lot of great free ones too. The device itself is small but doesn't feel cheap. I did add small pieces of double sided tape so it sticks better to my desk top. I love this little thing. To echo some of the other reviewers here, if you can afford it, buy a bigger model. I will upgrade at some point but for now the six button one suits my needs and with folders I'll have way more options.I didn't have any issues installing, no technical issues, the little screens are bright and the animated icons are awesome. All in all this is a fantastic device for multimedia, productivity uses and I'm sure it's incredible for streaming and gaming as well. Highly recommended!",
        "Exactly what I was looking for.  The folder function gives you way more than 6 buttons.  Software is intuitive and works with most apps out of the box.  3rd party profiles (use at own risk) available for most other apps."

I would pay way now for these cuz they are much more worth it. Easy to connect. Never had an issue with the adhesive and we live in dry, hot las gas.",
        "I recently purchased the Govee RGBIC LED Strip Lights, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision! These smart LED lights have completely transformed my bedroom atmosphere.Installation: The installation process was a breeze. The 16.4ft length is perfect for outlining my shelves and bed frame, and the adhesive backing is strong enough to keep the strips securely in place.App Control: The Govee app is user-friendly and offers a ton of customization options. I love being able to adjust colors, brightness, and modes right from my phone. The DIY color feature is particularly impressive, allowing me to create unique color combinations on one line—perfect for setting different moods.Music Sync: One of my favorite features is the music sync option. Whether I’m having a chill night in or hosting a party, the lights pulse and change in rhythm with the music, creating an immersive experience that everyone enjoys.Multiple Color Modes: The RGBIC technology allows for multiple colors to be displayed simultaneously, making it visually stunning. I’ve experimented with different scenes and effects, and they never fail to impress.Overall Performance: The lights are bright and vibrant, and the quality is excellent. I appreciate how versatile they are for home decor, whether I want a cozy vibe or something more energetic.",
        "I’m a big fan of Govee lights, and I own several of their products! The app is super easy to set up and use, and all of your Govee products will be right there. The preset scenes are fantastic, and I love that you can create your own for a unique vibe every time. The lights are bright and vibrant, with adjustable brightness, and the adhesive holds really well. I did have a minor hiccup with this particular set—some of the lights stopped working after about a month. However, the return process was smooth, and Govee quickly sent a replacement. My only downside is the short return window, which makes it tricky for those of us who don’t live close to a return drop-off, so I will also have to pay for the replacement set now as well. Overall, though, these lights are awesome!"

        "I have super sensitive eyes, by the end of the day at a factory job the lights alone made me nearly blind by the end of the day. I was having to squint and be a few inches from something to read it. On top of that TV time and phone time was only making it worse. 2days wearing these and I don't feel like a 78 year old man anymore. Great quality and cool case that it comes with;  couldn't recommend it enough",
        "Very nice glasses. They look like an expensive pair of glasses AND work well for computer or gaming.",
        "I've been using ANYLUV Blue Light Blocking Glasses for over two years now, and they have become an essential part of my daily routine. As someone who spends countless hours in front of screens, these glasses have been a game-changer in terms of alleviating eye strain and preventing headaches.The most notable benefit of these glasses is their ability to effectively block blue light. Since incorporating them into my daily wear, I've noticed a significant reduction in eye fatigue and discomfort, particularly after long hours of screen time. I can confidently say that wearing these glasses has made a noticeable difference in my overall comfort and productivity.Comfort is another key feature of these glasses. They fit comfortably on my face without feeling too tight or restrictive, allowing me to wear them for extended periods without any discomfort. Additionally, their lightweight design makes them easy to wear throughout the day without causing any strain on my nose or ears.Furthermore, I appreciate the stylish and modern design of these glasses. They complement my everyday look seamlessly and add a touch of sophistication to my attire. Whether I'm working from home or heading out for errands, these glasses always receive compliments for their sleek appearance.However, one minor drawback is that the lenses tend to scratch more easily than expected. While this hasn't affected their overall performance, it's worth noting for those who prioritize durability in their eyewear.In conclusion, ANYLUV Blue Light Blocking Glasses have been a lifesaver for me in combating eye strain and headaches caused by prolonged screen exposure. Their comfortable fit, stylish design, and effective blue light blocking technology make them a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to prioritize eye health in today's digital age. Despite the minor issue with lens scratching, I highly recommend these glasses to anyone seeking relief from the strains of modern-day screen usage."

        "These are easy to put on your  controller, you just slip them right over the little joystick. They give you alot more of precision and accuracy in the games you are playing. You will notice a BIG DIFFERENCE. I honestly didn't think you would but, I was really surprised, you really do.There are so many times you need to have that tiny little touch in aiming and these will allow that. This will make a difference in winning or losing a game.You get 3 different feels of these little rings, a light, medium and firmer feel. You can switch them out if you choose to anytime you need to according to the game you are playing. They are very delicate, so they need to be handled with care. But, if handled with care when applying, they will last you and you will agree, they are well worth the money and mean the difference between winning or losing your game.",

It would be really nice if there was a way to add the charge cable to the phone while it sat, so he could charge his phone while he talked. As it is now the phone sits on the bottom blocking the charge port but that would just be a nice extra. As it stands the phone holder is cute and sturdy enough to hold his phone."

        "I impulse purchased all three varieties of projector lights when they were on a Lightning Deal. I purchased with the intent of giving them to my kids for their room. However, after setting them up, I ended up keeping two out of the three because one arrived broken.I started off with the nebula cloud projector first then paired it up with the second projector with the blue stars. My first impression was mixed to be honest because of a few issues.1. The size of the cloudThe nebula cloud is quite beautiful and mesmerizing and really creates a serene ambiance. But I was a little disappointed with the size of it in relation the ceiling. It didn’t seem quite big enough to me at the time. I do not have huge ceilings either. After playing with the angles, I managed to get a more than adequate nebula cloud. Be sure to use a somewhat extreme angle, if you can get it to stay, which brings me to my next issue.2. Housing material (angling and getting it to stay)The housing of the unit and the base it sits on is a smooth, matte plastic with no “grip” at all. When you try to angle the unit to project onto the ceiling it typically slips or moves, altering the angle you want. I found that using the foam inserts that come inside the box serves as a much better base due to the cut outs and the slight grip to it. I highly recommend keeping those! If you already threw them out perhaps try cutting some floral foam to create a base like the insert from the box. Alternatively, stick some double sided tape on the inside of the curve of the smooth base for some grip.The projector is also somewhat delicate, as one of the three I ordered arrived broken. The green star projector still turns on but the motor no longer rotates so the nebula cloud doesn’t “move” anymore. I highly suggest you avoid moving the projector too much or too often and definitely do NOT drop it. Find a good place and leave it alone.3. App controlMy final issue has to do with the app. I read reviews so I had an idea of what to expect. You can either search on the App Store or scan the QR code on one of the flaps inside the box. Either way will work. Many users stated that they had problems either connecting the projector to the device or it took a while to respond. Others stated they had no problems at all. It seems to be hit or miss. I personally did not use the BlissHome app because I don’t want any more of my information spread around like confetti. Also, I happen to be a bit more in the camp of you shouldn’t NEED an app to control this thing. Yes, apps are cool but sometimes I feel like they are unnecessary as in this case. But that’s just my opinion. Anyway, I was a bit bummed that I wouldn’t be able to do other scenes and customization to the projector without the app. I seriously contemplated send them all back. That is, until I changed out some regular light bulbs for some Cree Lighting smart LED bulbs and set them up using my Cree Lighting app (that I already had and use). Lo and behold, the projectors popped up in the devices ready for pairing and set up!!! In the end, I was able to successfully pair both projectors (and some LED desk lights I’ve had for over a year now) using the Cree Lighting app without any issues at all. I can now control and customize both projectors and my desk lights. I can adjust brightness, colors, laser opacity, and set “scenes” that are included with the projectors and lights that I didn’t even know were included.My recommendation is if you don’t want to use the BlissHome app or give away your information yet again to the app developers, try another app you already have. You might be pleasantly surprised. If you don’t have an app that works then try the Cree Lighting app or LED Light Controller & Remote app.On a side note, once I was able to customize the settings inside the Cree Lighting app, I realized it wasn’t that much outside of just using the button on projector itself. Sure, I can adjust brightness and star opacity and set custom colors using the Cree app. But beyond that, you can still access the same “scenes” programmed in by simply pressing the button on the projector.Overall, I do like these projectors. The colors are quite beautiful and the laser stars really bring it to another level. The stars come in either blue or green. As stated before, I purchased both. For more contrast, I would suggest the green stars. For a more ethereal look, go with the blue. If you want more oomf to your nebula, then pair the nebula only projector with the cloud and star projector. Are they worth the price? Yes, but only if you are able to buy them on sale. I don’t think the regular price is justified considering they are somewhat fragile.I decided to set up both projectors (nebula only and nebula with blue stars) in the master bathroom to use during my shower instead of a candle. I also play some ambient music. Together, they really create a relaxing atmosphere akin my own private spa that helps relieve stress and unwind from the day. My husband also thinks they are pretty cool and requested one in the bedroom too. 😂",
        "The HD stars and the level of customization options really exceeded my expectations. I could easily change the colors, patterns, and even adjust the brightness to create the perfect atmosphere for any mood.It’s been a fantastic addition to our bedroom, especially when winding down before sleep. The soft glow and starry sky create a calming environment that helps us relax, and it also serves as a great night light. Overall, I couldn’t be happier with this purchase. It’s not only visually stunning but also functional—highly recommend for anyone looking to enhance their space!",
        "We originally bought the black astronaut projector light that people were raving about. It came defective. Something was lose and rattling inside of it and remote didn't work, we sent it back got a replacement and then I realized it just seemed cheap for the price I paid also daughter didn't love the light effect so we returned the replacement and went with this one instead. So glad we did. My daughter absolutely loves this. It's beautiful and seems good quality. Only downfall is it comes with no remote. Unfortuantly it kinda stinks that you need a phone around to change the settings. Wish it came with both options. If my daughter didn't have her own phone it would have been a problem to use my phone all the time to switch her light. ( which is the only downfall) Also had trouble with it connecting/ syncing with our wifi it kept saying error had to try it 6 times before it connected not sure why but ultimately it finally synced and we love it. No complaints other than no remote and will probably get myself one too 😌"

        "After trying to get a good price for a 240HZ 1080p monitor, i couldn't find any better option.There's other brands in the market that might be more known and maybe add an extra price for some other features but i think this monitor a pretty decent option. I had no issues installing it, and the fuctionality has been great for competitive games where the 240hz might make a difference.I think it's pretty good if you're looking for an affordable 240hz option.The packaging was pretty well done and there was no missing parts and no shipment damages which is what mostly concerns me when buying monitors.",
        "Delivery was quick, setup was easy, and it works. I have not found any dead pixels. The included stand is basic but sturdy with only a tilt adjustment. The screen is fantastic, it's bright and the colors are vivid. I'm loving all the space this 34\" ultrawide is giving me. I also love the curve which I wasn't sure of before I tried it. The built-in speakers are maybe laptop quality so I recommend external speakers or a headset. The bottom line is that it's a beautiful screen with great specs at a very good price.",

        "Needed a major upgrade on my keyboard and mouse I’ve had for a couple years and was looking for something that is of good quality and also decently priced. I’ve had another keyboard from the same brand and loved the mechanical feel to it and how compact it was, hence my interest in purchasing another one from this same brand and a much fuller keyboard. My last RedDragon keyboard has lasted me since 2017 and just broke in 2024.When it arrived it was neatly packaged with a great presentation once you open it. It’s very lightweight and easy to install and connect well, just plug it in and you’re set! It does have different light settings for the keyboard, which you will be able to see in the manual. The keyboard I purchased were soft keys, although I wish I purchased the mechanical one - so be mindful on your preference of keys. The soft keys are very lightweight and easy to press, no issues. Keyboard quality is great for the price, and is perfect for my needs as I just need a keyboard that works and can handle simple gaming, not much expectations in terms of speed, performance, etc. Mouse is also great for the price, but don’t expect a high quality/pro mouse as there is a big difference when you feel it/use it. You can also adjust the mouse speed from the middle button as well. Overall you get a good deal with quality & affordability.10/10, great option to choose for beginners, those who are looking for affordable sets, looking for a spare/backup set, or interested in giving as a gift. I would choose purchasing this over the cheaper in-store options since there are more reliable reviews for this product and can also vouch via my experience.",
        "Nice and compact, yet has all keys, special functions and more!Can change backlight color and display, I prefer steady red - awesome when working at night or dark room, as I often do.Key press is soft, not a mechanical \"click\".Mouse has very good steady weighted and smooth feel.I bought a second one for my other system!",
        "I searched pretty extensively on Amazon to find/land on this keyboard for laptop at a reasonable price. I wanted a keyboard with good back-lighting in white that is easy to see under low lighting conditions, but I like it that there are multiple back-light color options. The keyboard is great for accessing laptop more comfortably and when sitting on couch with keyboard in lap. I can see where the blue and red might also be useful for different lighting conditions. The mouse was a bonus for me and it is a very ergonomic and comfortable mouse - better than the expensive Logitech mouse I was using. I'd rather have the wireless version of the keyboard and mouse combo, but this product gets the job done satisfactorily."

        "Works wonderfully for me. I have so many devices that I wanted some vertical storage on my end table. My table has just enough of a flat lip to get mounted to as expected. My phone sits in the bottom left when put down as well. This way I don’t have to shuffle things around as before. Easy to set up and the quality is great. No complaints here. Cost is reasonable- if it works for your situation I think you’ll find it cost effective. Many small organizational items are quite pricey on their own and this covers several. It can be used vertically (I have it landscape). Overall, very satisfied.",

        "I took my time researching just the right ExtensionThis one fit the bill for me perfectlyAll the outlets are strategically placed so you can use all of them. The USB outlets are great.!And to top it off this is actually I appealing and sturdy",
        "So, for some background, I have been an Amazon member for about 5 years now, and the funny thing is, I never write reviews... However, that has changed... This is my first review and it's due to the fact that I have recommended this product to over 5 companies and roughly 30 people... Every one of them thought it was amazing and has thanked me since then... I see a huge need for this product. I will be discussing the pros and cons... This is my opinion and my opinion alone.---Pros---Build Quality.The build quality is insane, most power outlets compensate for things like materials. However, the material is hard plastic so it can take a serious beating.Anti-Slip Feet.Now, you might not care... however I thought it should be mentioned as it is one of the companies highlighting factors... I think this is great, it never slips up and I've owned this for 1 year now, and I've never had it slide... I'd consider this a quality of life, don't know you need it until you have it...Surge Protector.I wouldn't say that you would need this, however, it's a nice addition... makes worrying about 15 Amps a little less worrisome...On/Off Button.You Wouldn't believe me if I told you that I put this on here, however, I did, and I'm going to stick with it... This power button is a heavy-duty switch, which means you can't flip it like cutting into butter, you actually compared to other plugs have to try... The trying isn't so hard, but it's nice to know that if you accidentally almost click it, it won't flip off, this can be especially nice if you have 3 computers attached to 1 plug, like me...Indicator LightsI love the feeling of knowing things work so, these indicator lights help with my feeling of the unknown, if you are afraid just know, the light side got your back, bro...Included EverythingI love that they add everything that you would ever need, instead of adding it as an extra. Lets you know that the price is well worth the investment.PriceThe price is actually REALLY cheap, and that might fear people away, however, I'm here to tell you that nothing is compromised for this plug...DiscountsI love discounts, and seeing that this company offers regular discounts for the \"6.5 Cord Outlet\" is a sign that these people care about our wallets... The discounts can range anywhere from 5% to 45%... (45% being holidays like Black Friday or Cyber Monday)Spacing Design.The design of this outlet is beyond my comprehension. I currently use this for both my big and small plugs, due to the side plugs this outlet doesn't compensate for any outlets... I have enough space to plug in a massive plug into the side with enough space to wiggle, no touching... So, those annoying 240v plugs won't decrease the number of plugs this has...USB DesignThere are 6 USBs and if you're wondering these USBs can charge my IPhone SE (2020) 0-100 in 20 Minutes Flat... (if nothing else is hooked up in other USBs)CordThe cord is HEAVY-DUTY stuff I mean... what the heck, maybe a little over the top, but I like over the top so, it's a pro, not a con...Wall MountIt's nice to see that wall mounts are included, It makes it easier for my studio setup...---Cons---TravelingYea, if you are planning on traveling with this thing, good luck, it's pretty big... I wouldn't recommend doing that, however, if you do, super lightweight...Amp CountA lot of people tell me there are A LOT of amps in this thing, and they would be right, however, that is for a good reason... The only reason why the amps are high is due to the fact that it has 22 Outlets and 6 USB slots... OF COURSE, you're going to need a lot of Amps...ConclusionI think I've spoken long enough, what it boils down to is whether you want it or not, like I said this is my opinion and so, it helps when you try it for yourself... but like anything, if you don't treat it with respect it will break, however, this one takes quite a bit to break... hahahaFinal Remarks to CompanyHere are a few suggestions I have to add some Jazz to your already Jazzed up product...--- Product Recommendations ---1. Make the plugin on the side able to move. Like, not side to side but up and down, and make them so they have notches so they can stay in one place without moving over time... but I think more flexible on those side plugins would be amazing since anyways they look like they can move... hahaha2. I don't know if this would mess with the circuits but it would be worth looking into is make it so that you can attach this product to metal with magnets on the bottom I've run into a couple of people who said it would be cool to add a powerful magnet on the back so that you can connect it to a film set or studio equipment...3. Keep doing what you're doing... It's great so don't stop doing it..."

        "Where to begin.Cosmetically, these headphones look awesome and are great quality. The plastic seems to be durable but overall could be a bit better 4/5The hub is amazing. Being able to put the headphones down and charge them whenever without needing a cord is a HUGE gamechanger. You can switch between PC, XBOX, PS5, and Bluetooth seamlessly. 5/5The audio is about as good as it gets for gaming headphones. Audiophiles will want to look towards actual studio headphones instead, as they headphones are really just means for game explosions and sound effects. 4/5Comfort - The stock earphones are wildly comfortable. Very soft and pleasant, and prevent the headaches some headphones can give you. You can also swap them out easily as they are magnetically attached. 5/5Overall, definitely worth the price tag. 5/5",
        "Look no further if you, like me, needed a wireless pair of headphones for gaming across PC and console (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch). This device makes it effortless to switch between them all, and even still pair a phone or other device via Bluetooth at the same time.Functionality is fantastic! Fit is just like the pair of Astros you already have. Battery life is fantastic, and makes the value of the headset really shine. These are comfy, designed well for ease of use, and all the other things you want from a headphone.Last but not least, the sound is top notch. You get hires audio on PC, and great lossless audio on console. The kicker is the automatic Dolby Atmos and the partnership with better integration via Microsoft devices.The new Logitech G hub integration gives just a touch more control than the older Astro Command Center. Community EQ profiles are great addition!",
        "I have the A50 Gen 4 and the audio is top notch, but was lacking Bluetooth. Bought the A50 Gen 5, which is Logitech's official label, and I am not disappointed with the quality and audio performance of this headset. I am able to connect to multiple platforms, but I mainly use them on the PC. The best feature is the simultaneous source audio and Bluetooth!! This headset is very versatile when it comes to feature access. The same features on PC/Mac can be accessed on the phone app when using Xbox, PS, or Switch.I love that I can use my current 3rd party ear cushions from my Gen4s on this headset.I have had no issues with my Gen4s, and I assume to have the same experience with the Gen5s.Audio fidelity is a personal preference, and that is why I don't emphasize on that topic. So, it is my opinion that the audio on these headphones are one of the best that I have heard. The microphone is broadcast quality and can be adjusted to your liking.Battery life is as advertised and expected.Try them for yourself, My guess is that you will be very satisfied with this headset."

        "The value was great at the time and my son needed a much better headset than the ol' 5$-10$ \"gaming headsets\" from whatever cheap store. Basically lil man showed he could take care of headsets and we graduated to a nice wireless set! TB has always been good for me in the past so i figure I'll go for it. He absolutely loves them!The battery life is great, the voice quality is very good, the connectivity is great and overall the set has good functionality. He also says they are super comfortable and don't hurt his ears! Said they have really loud sound and he can hear enemies much better. He says he definitely recommends it to all his friends!",
        "I just got these headphones a couple days ago and I love them! I can pair it with my phone, my daughter can pair it to her switch, the wireless mode with USB is what I use with my Xbox.  No connectivity issues unless I walk into the next room with the USB wireless mode, which is to be expected.  Bluetooth is crystal clear across my home!  I like that the mouthpiece folds into the headset because I have dumb animals that chew on those parts.  It also fits my head.  I don't have a huge head but I have a bit of a noggin.Sound! The important part!  Very clear, plenty loud for me but I'm sure some psychos want their stuff even louder? I don't run them on max, no need to, they block external sound pretty dang good.Im giving these a 10 out of 10.  Compared to what some models of these gaming headsets cost, these are a solid build of purpose and functionality!  Does all that I need them to do, convenient usb-c charge port, comfortable on the dome, sound amazing, and less thab $100!",
        "This is what I get for buying a cheaper model. This will not connect to the Xbox Series X model. Oddly, the microphone works just fine, but you can't hear anything when in party mode. That's usually the case for uncertified models of headsets, learned my lesson 3 times. It's literally an Xbox Chat issue, cause it works fine outside of chat and can use just fine as bluetooth for phone calls. Just refuses to let you speak and hear friends in chat. Very disappointed and all the support from Xbox does not work, very repetitive. Spend the money and get the better models or higher end headsets from other manufacturers."

        "Logitech has done an outstanding job manufacturing a wireless competitive gaming mouse. I personally will never be sold on the idea of a wireless mouse being better than a wired one just because of signal interference alone, this does not detract from the fact that this mouse is indeed a dam good mouse even for fast pace FPS shooters. I will try to go in order writing my review of this mouse from opening to playing with it.*Packaging*For a $150 mouse I expected more from the packaging however I do understand that maybe Logitech wanted to keep things simple. There is no wow factor here just a simple small box wrapped in plastic. Looking at it from the outside you wouldn't be able to tell this thing costs$150.*Opening*So once I got into the box that looks as though the contents of it didn't cost $150, I was once again taken aback. Reason being that the mouse was just sitting there unwrapped. The reason this kinda surprised me was because I had to make sure that I didn't accidentally order a used mouse. Nothing against used electronics but I generally stay away from them because they could potentially have unseen underlying issues, however Amazon and their generous return policy has restored some of my confidence in buying them but I did not want to go that route with this mouse at this price point. The mouse did have tape on the underside once I lifted it from its cradle  but again I did double check to make sure that it wasn't a used product. I removed the tape from the underside and checked the mouse skates for any signs of scratches and everything was cool.*Package Contents*The package contained what you'd expect. The mouse, a wireless dongle, and a cord all wrapped and in good condition. One thing that concerned me that I wasn't sure about was whether or not the buttons on the right side of the mouse were preinstalled and to my relief they weren't. The reason I say this is because I prefer not to disassemble my electronics if I don't have to, if you have to then you gotta do what you gotta do but I work in maintenance and repeatedly taking something apart and putting it back together causes excessive wear and damage and I'd prefer keeping my $150 mouse in pristine condition other than normal wear and tear.*The Mouse*The mouse itself felt great, it felt solid and sound. The shell was sturdy I'm a heavy handed individual and I was comfortable applying normal pressures from my hands to the mouse with fear or it being damaged or broken. The mouse slides gracefully across the mouse pad out of the box so you won't encounter issues there, I would've preferred they used the mouse skates Razer has been using on their largest mice but it is what it is I ordered some Hyperglides to replace them.*Installation*So the mouse is plug & play, I already had G Hub installed and the software recognized the hardware  no problem. I didn't have to update any firmware or anything so that was cool I just plugged the dongle into the computer and turned the mouse on from the bottom and it was good to go.*The feels*So I have large hands and going into this I expected it to be small for my hands and I was correct. I use somewhat of a palm claw hybrid and I found that I had some empty space between my hand and the mouse itself which is kinda like a dead zone and could cause slop when making fast movements. Like I said I anticipated this going in so I can't say I'm disappointed. The side buttons are nice as well as far as where they are positioned and how they feel when you press them, they're very responsive. My only gripe would really be to move them back a little but I attribute that to the size of the mouse itself if the mouse was a little larger they'd naturally be further back. The button position in relation to the size of the mouse is fine and about where you'd expect them to be. The two main mouse buttons feel pretty good as well the clicks sound good and feel equally as good I had no double click issues or indications thereof. One thing to really look out for are people buying this product used from someone else who had the double click issue and sending it back then someone else buys the mouse again with the same problem and all of a sudden a lot of people end up sharing the same mouse with the same issue leaving the same review complaining about the same problem. I've encountered no double click issue so far. The weight of the mouse itself is great as well it feels really balanced not too light but not too heavy.*Tracking*So this is where the rubber meets the road, I wanted to test just how good this mouse is and if it's as good as they say it is. I tried this thing out not in Microsoft word or nothing like that I went straight to Apex Legends and COD. I went into G Hub to check my configurations and much to my surprise I didn't have to do anything another good thing about G Hub is that your settings apply universally to all Logitech mice so because I had profiles set up for one mouse they assumed it'd be the same for this one so that was a good surprise. The mouse tracked very well I have to admit I was impressed for a wireless mouse that didn't fit my hands that well I performed amicably and even was champion a few games and I'm not one to argue with results. The mouse tracked even my most minute movements without skipping a beat.*Conclusion*I was on the fence about even picking up a wireless mouse because I wasn't sure if the technology was really ready for competitive gaming but it has come a long way. My only real issue with wireless is the batteries, no matter how good the battery may be eventually it will wear out and turn your wireless mouse back into a wired one Logitech could circumvent this by making the battery removable but they'd sell less mice in doing so. Which leads me to the reason I chose Logitech over Razer because I've had to trash a wireless mouse once already in the past granted the technology back then isn't what it was today. I'll hold on to the mouse because I like it and it performs it will be the one in the arsenal. I've attached some photos of the mouse alongside some more other popular mice in the game for size comparison. Enjoy.",
        "**Product Review: GPW Pro Mouse**I recently got my hands on the GPW Pro Mouse, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. First and foremost, the build quality is outstanding. The mouse feels solid and well-crafted, with no signs of wear or tear after weeks of use. It’s clear that this is a product built to last.What truly sets the GPW Pro apart, though, is its performance. The response time is incredibly rapid, making it perfect for both gaming and professional work. Whether I'm playing fast-paced games or working on detailed projects, the mouse consistently delivers precision and speed. The wireless connection is flawless, with no noticeable lag or dropouts, which is a huge plus.The ergonomics are another highlight. The GPW Pro fits comfortably in my hand, and the lightweight design ensures that long sessions don't lead to fatigue. The customizable buttons are a great touch, allowing for a personalized experience that suits my specific needs.Overall, the GPW Pro Mouse is a top-tier product that combines durability, performance, and comfort. If you're looking for a reliable and responsive mouse, this one should be at the top of your list. Highly recommended!",
        "1 - AMBIDEXTROUS. First of all, I want to say thank you Logitech for making this ambidextrous to the point it is optimal for left handed use. Thanks to a physical condition, I can only use mouses left handed. There is very few options for people who can only use mouses left handed for gaming, and times are looking grim due to recent news regarding left handed mices. Thankfully, ambidextrous designs exist, and I can easily say that this is THE BEST mouse for left handed users, even better than my previous mouse. I hope to see ambidextrous designs continue down the line, and also bonus points for allowing brief customization that allows it to be a left-handed mice.2 - PERFORMANCE. Anyways, I've been using this mouse for almost three months now. Its quite clear that I'm more than satisfied with this mouse, and its not just because its ambidextrous. The wireless performance for this mouse has been on point. I've yet to catch mouse lag. Granted, its only been a few months, but it has shown an equivalence of wired mice performance. At first I was skeptical, but not only has this mice proven to me that its as good as wired mices, it has also made wired mices feel like an annoyance to the point where I don't think I could go back to wired mices. Its hard for something to get in the way thanks to how open the mice is, on top of it being pretty damn light. Using this mice is a breeze. So yeah, this mice is on point on wireless performance, and takes advantage of the benefits of wireless mices.3 - BATTERY LIFE. I will flat out say that the battery life is as good as said. One of the obvious flaws of wireless mices is that they need to be charged. Thankfully, depending on lighting settings, it can last for quite a long time, to the point I forget this mice even needs to be charged. With my current setting, it can last over 60 hours. Logitech has done an amazing job minimizing the flaws of wireless in this mouse.4 - DURABILITY. Its only been a few months since I've used this. Although I've yet to get my mouse into a breaking point, I've developed a bad habit of hitting the side of my keyboard with the top end of my mouse. Despite doing it at times I don't even notice even scratches on the mice. So far, its holding although I've only used this for just a few months.5 - FLAWS?. If there is anything I don't really like about this mice, its the awkward setup. More specifically the end of the cable having a claw-like design. It seemed weird at first, but its as basic as it can get.6 - FINAL THOUGHTS. At first I was somewhat afraid due to the mouse size and the price. My hand is 21x11 cm, and so far I found this mice comfortable. As for price, even though it is $150, I was willing to pay premium just for a good mice for left-handed use. It accommodates for me, it was an upgrade for me, and I am more than happy with this mice alone. There were also comments regarding left and right click overlapping, but that was not the case for my mouse, and this was more of an issue for older G Pro Wireless mices. Wasn't an issue for me which I got in October.Overall, I personally LOVE this mice. Amazing wireless performance on top of maximizing the benefits and does its best minimizing the flaws of wireless.  The ambidextrous design is phenomenal and a dream as a left-handed user. if I could rate it higher than 5/5, I would. Thank you, Logitech."

        "Love the keys. Love the brown switches. Love the keycaps even. They feel nice. Yes, it's edgy space font but it's not TOO bad. About a 2/10 on the HR Giger scale. Only one problem:WASD is dumb. Very very dumb. Why? I don't care that it's what the entire world uses. If you learn how to touch type, your left hand will naturally fall on the home key, F. That's why it has a little nub on it. So you can develop feel memory and just know your fingers are on the home keys. So why wouldn't you use ESDF instead? Then you get a pinky key too. A. WASD is stupid. Sorry.Anyhow, they put the first completely smooth F key on anything I've ever seen in my life. I had to throw it away. I had a few spares. It looks awesome with a proper F key that's a different color. I use F a lot. : ) So it's important that it's correct. Now I can find my movement keys by feel again. I don't have to waste time looking.Superglue, that's up to you. This is a personal preference. I put a little dab on the wrist rest to make it permanent. I loved it so much. I just put it on the magnets and let them be together forever. It's better that way.Otherwise, wow what a nice addition to a Star Citizen setup. This sits nicely off to the left of a VKB Omni-Throttle for quick accessible on-foot controls, or anything else. Opening up the mobiglass quick because you have a real F1 key. Etc. tapping escape to fix a keybind quick. Setting up a macro for Flight > ATC > VTOL. Makes the game that much better. Worth every penny.It gets a five for value. They are using good quality parts. They did put thought into the design. Like you can tell it was designed for your fingers to fall on F key home position based on where the space is placed. You literally have to stretch to hit it if you use wasd. ESDF? your hand just falls naturally on everything. So nice. The switches feel great. Love that soft bump in the press. You subconsciously start remembering where that bump happens and it improves your timing because it coincides with actuation. That's the benefit of browns for gaming. You aren't just mashing the key into the board for timing. You don't have to. So your keyboard takes less abuse. And you maintain a lower level of chill, so game better.Very comfortable. Perfect wrist rest. Perfect key position. Great key caps. Great lighting, Oh great lighting options. They offer five. For me it was like, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, OH!. The fifth one I liked a lot. It's a blue and green burst gradient. Very awesome looking. Matches my stuff.The only other thing to maybe complain about is it slides around a little. Like the bottom isn't grippy enough. Easily fixed with two pieces of VHB tape on the bottom but worth mentioning.I am one very happy customer.",

        "I recently upgraded to the Logitech G502 X Plus Lightspeed Wireless Optical Mouse, after having the same $15.00 mouse for over 7 years. and I’m thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. Its lightweight, has a long battery life, ability to change DPI on the fly, and simply looks clean.Performance:The LIGHTSPEED wireless technology is a game-changer. I’ve experienced zero lag or connectivity issues, which is crucial for any game, rather it be Stardew Valley, or high precision requirements such as CS2. The HERO 25K sensor is incredibly accurate, offering pinpoint precision that has noticeably improved my in-game performance. The adjustable DPI settings are a huge plus, allowing me to switch between high and low sensitivity effortlessly.Features:The mouse has 13 customizable controls for you to assign shortcuts/hotkeys too for MMORPG gaming, or MOBA gaming. Changing these hotkeys is simply one program away, downloadable on the Logitech Website. Use of this application also allows the user to change the RGB patterning that is displayed along the mouse. The G502X does also feature the ability to use PowerPlay and charge your mouse, wirelessly, with an additional purchase of course.Cons:With anything the cost can be pretty high for this peripheral, especially if you purchase the additional PowerPlay ability, this Mouse + Pad could be fairly expensive.Overall, after 1 month I am highly satisfied with my purchase, the mouse is just so comfortable to use for 8+ hours of desk work, or gaming activities.",
        "I've been a long time user of the G602 and G604, but both were heavy, and the 604 replaced the 602, and has since been discontinued and not replaced.  So after searching for mice with extra buttons near the thumb but also comfortable with a lot of the features I've loved in the 604.  While the G502 X didn't fill all those needs, it's been a great choice.Pros:- Ergonomic - It just fits my (rather large) hand well in a few different positions, and is so light I've found my wrist fatigue has been reduced significantly. Unlike the 604, I can press every button easily without looking for them, particularly the scroll wheel, DPI adjustments, and 3 easy to find thumb buttons is great. It also feels comfortable, which is hard to describe, but the material feel is what I want in a mouse.- Light - I mentioned this in the ergonomic part, but its super light.  Apparently it's around 105 grams, which can be heavy for an ultra-competitive mouse, but for most gamers or folks just looking for a light wireless mouse, it's great.- Great button feel - The older Logitech mice used to have a weird mushy click and my old 602 and 604 both had issues where the button would stop working well.  The new G502 X models have a new mechanical click that feels amazing. Very much like a mechanical keyboard as far as consistancy and feedback.  Not every button has the same feel, but they all feel very tactile and reliable.- Great battery life - I can get 3 weeks on a full charge at 1000 hz poling rate.  Don't bother with smaller polling rates, as when the mouse isn't being used it's not a power issue, and when it is in use, it's still not a huge power issue.  You might get a few extra days at best, but if 3 weeks isn't enough charge time for you, I'd be shocked.- USB-C charging - Sad that this is still a plus, but USB-C cables are so much better.  Glad we're finally starting to no longer see Micro-USB cables.- Works Wired  - Forgot to charge it?  You can use it wired, or use it while charging (Either works).- Great sensitivity - The mouse is so adjustable, I found I could turn it down from my usual DPI and get both great responsiveness and accuracy with a near default config.- Customizable - Logitech G software has flaws, but it does allow some pretty good versatile configurations. Every button can be remapped and remapping can be done on a per-app basis.- Logitech Support - I've had multiple issues with Logitech mice long into their service but under warranty, and Logitech has always been easy to work with to get a replacement or help.  This sounds like I'm saying Logitech has a quality issue, and I'm not, I know stuff happens, particularly with high use products, so it's good they stand by them.Cons:- Large - It's not a small mouse, so if you have small hands, it could be a little large for you.  It also means it's not easily portable, though honestly mice aren't that large in general, so portability isn't a major concern, and you can always get a mouse case if you travel a lot and want to protect it.- Logitech G Software sucks - I mean, it does OK, it can auto-sense games, you can copy profiles, but it has several general flaws, including if it detects a new game it generates that game's default setting that you CAN NOT CUSTOMIZE ahead of time.  If I have a known default mapping/DPI setting I know I like in most games, why can't I make that the default? Also, making button changes and navigation of the US is very unintuitive.  Like one of the worst UIs I've worked with on a major brand's software.  It also by default likes to spam notifications that is harder to turn off than I would have liked (Otherwise, every time the mouse gets touched, you get a windows notification or 3 about the mouse and DPI changes).  Their old software (pre 2015) was easy to use, and worked in the UI was nearly the exact opposite of this.  Fix your software Logitech!- No backup gliders - Not a deal breaker, as I know I've not had a mouse with glider issues in the past 10-15 years, but it would be nice, particularly on a gaming mouse where if the pads wear it could be noticeable for some. I don't need stickers Logitech, I'd rather have a replacement pad set.- No pinkie rest - Some mice have a nice pinkie rest that helps you relax your hand a bit.  This mouse does not. That's definitely a personal thing, and honestly most gaming mice have moved away from this due to weight, but with a large hand, I like mice with them.Overall, it's a great mouse with a lot going for it. I'm enjoying using it, have found my hand/arm feel better after a day of using it vs my old mouse, and love all the features it offers that I can look past any small shortcomings.Who do I recommend this mouse for?  Artists who need finite DPI control.  Office workers who want a bigger mouse (there are cheaper options, but it's a solid productivity mouse).  People who use their computer for a significant time.  Casual gamers. Competitive gamers who want an all in one mouse.  It's a good mouse for a lot of use cases, which is why I'm giving it a 5 star review.  It's not perfect, but very few products are, and it's strong where it needs to be.",
        "For about the last decade I’ve used the same mouse, a Logitech G502 Proteus Core, this mouse’s great great great grandparent. In that time I became accustomed to the particular shape and feel of this mouse, the incredibly intuitive placement of extra buttons, and the surprisingly decent software (which has had its ups and downs over the years but has consistently remained functional for me).I previously avoided upgrades to the G502 Proteus Core because it did everything I needed from a mouse, never broke, never needed a new battery, and was rock solid reliable over USB. But recently I started wondering again if wireless mouse technology had advanced enough to make it competitive with wired.Enter the G502X Lightspeed, my first wireless mouse in over a decade. Overall I like this mouse more than my Proteus Core. The wireless tech has been almost perfectly reliable for me. The only issue I have with it vs a wired variant is that it takes a second to adjust to its settings after waking up from sleep. I’ve had zero dropped inputs or noticeable lag. In this sense, it has been as reliable as I expect a mouse to be and really confirmed the strides there have been in wireless technology. The lack of RGB lights is a welcome change for me. I always kept the blue lighting disabled on my Proteus Core, so to not have any unlit light spots or lighting settings to deal with has been nice for me. Battery life has been great. I use this mouse for about 12 hours a day between work and personal computers and get about 3 weeks between charges. I doubt the battery will let this last as long as my Proteus Core before it needs to be serviced or replaced, but for the benefits of no cord drag, I’m willing to accept that I think. The clicks are a little more hollow-sounding than on the original, but seem to be just as or more accurate. I prefer a heavier mouse, so I slightly miss the heft of the Proteus Core, but I’ve quickly adjusted to the pleasant weight of this mouse which is still a bit heavier than many of its competitors. The slight change in shape is better for my hand and typical palm grip, I can feel the improvement in my ability to reach buttons and in day-long use comfort. The scroll wheel isn’t as substantial, but it still offers a very pleasant endless scroll and a tactile locked scroll feeling.This mouse is a worthy successor to the Proteus Core throne and it does so many things right that its trade-offs are worth it to me. The G502 line continues to be my favorite way to interact with a computer, and I’m glad to see Logitech continuing to improve and commit resources to this great series of mice."

I might actually sit at my computer longer and get some work done.",
        "This foot rest is mostly great. It's a good height and I like the way it is squishy so you can move your foot around into comfortable positions. However, the cover is soft fabric. I really wish it was covered in a plastic or rubber that you could easily wipe off, instead of having to disassemble the product to take the cover off. Additionally, it needs a non-skid bottom so it doesn't slip all around the floor. It does have some dots that are supposed to hold it in place, but they don't work very well."

        "Firstly, I was most impressed with the quality of materials and design and how well it works! I expected it to my gimmicky and bought it just to try it out expecting to stop using it in short order. Instead, I find myself using it almost daily while working from home or playing video games at my computer desk. I also expected it to be at least somewhat uncomfortable, but I am able to wear it for hours at a time and I forget I have it on my hand. Another concern I had was my ability to actually use it effectively enough to justify using it instead of my fingers, but I was surprised to find it's incredibly intuitive and easy to use. It's almost like an extension of your fingers. I have tried it with snacks such as cheeze-its and flavored sunflower seeds (shelled) and it works both great for both! I was impressed with my ability to easily pick up sunflower seeds which are quite small. The rubber on the rips of the snacktiv provide a good grip on food items. One thing to consider is the Snacktiv is more effective when eating snacks from a bowl or plate rather than a bag. It is certainly possible to use it to eat directly from a chip bag for instance, but I find you end up getting your hand a bit messy reaching in the bag anyway and kind of defeats the purpose.",
        "The first impression people probably get when seeing these is that the manufacturing cost is probably not even close to the selling price, but sometimes you just don't care about the money and want to reduce hassle instead. These are basically small chopsticks that can't fall off your hand so they're quite useful for eating anything that doesn't need cutting up. Works well for typical snacks like chips but also things like smaller fruits. The small size is both an advantage and a drawback since you can't grasp a proper bite of regular food but it does allow you to precisely grasp the things that are small enough to fit. Either way, solves a lot of problems for people who impulsively wash their hands every 2 seconds because they feel like they've stained them.",
        "Really comfortable, and now I will never have sticky or dusty hands again! they feel really wonky to type with if your keyboard is at an angle. So you'll also have to drop your keyboard to use it. It also works surprisingly well if you use a vertical mouse! So keep that in mind :)"

        "This is my first mixer and it's pretty good, but it makes me immediately want to upgrade to a better unit.The main issue is that through the XLR input the volume is a bit low. It's not terrible, but it will need to be raised in post. Also being able to record up to 4 samples and play them back is cool, but the quality is pretty bad even though that might make them funnier.The sliders on mine were dirty/dusty so when I would slide the headphones one down to 0% it would play at 100%. A little contact cleaner fixed it and it hasn't happened again, but that could potentially damage your ears.The RGB is nice and can be turned off, but the volume indicator bars that constantly flash stay on which can be annoying in a dark room.Overall it's good for the price, but maybe spend a little more and get something a bit more professional."

        "I recently purchased KTRIO large mouse pad, and it has truly transformed my workspace! The first thing that caught my attention was the high-quality material. It's smooth to the touch and provides a comfortable surface for writing, typing, and even using my mouse without a separate mousepad.The size is perfect—large enough to cover my desk area while still leaving space for other items. I love how it protects my desk from scratches, spills, and general wear and tear. Plus, the design adds a sleek, professional look that enhances the overall aesthetics of my office.One of the best features is its non-slip base. It stays firmly in place, even when I'm moving around papers or my laptop. Cleaning it is also a breeze—just a quick wipe, and it's as good as new.Overall, this desk pad has improved both the functionality and appearance of my workspace. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their desk setup!",
        "Good quality materials. Thick material provides good cushion. The material works well as a mouse pad. The large pad is indeed large, covers my Ikea desk well. Provides a good cushion for writing. Soft touch. Pleased with my purchase. Recommended.",
        "I've had this mousepad for over a year, so here's what I think.First, the pros. The mousepad works well, giving my mouse a smooth surface to move on. The material feels nice and doesn't seem cheap, which is great for the price. It's also pretty tough, barely showing any wear even after a year of daily use.Now, the cons. Sometimes, it feels uncomfortable for my arms, especially if I use it for a long time, like during gaming or homework. This might be because it's a bit thin and doesn’t have much padding. This is just my issue and doesn't bug me a lot, but it might be something to consider if you use your mousepad.The design is simple and looks good on my desk without taking up too much space. It stays put and doesn’t slide around, which is super important. It's also easy to clean – I throw it in the washer on delicate with cool water, and it looks great.Overall, I think this mousepad is great. It's an awesome deal for the price because it does its job well and lasts a long time. If you need a good mousepad that’s affordable and reliable, I’d recommend this one."

        "Before buying this mouse, I was a G402 user since 2015 and as most button switches including the primary ones reached EOL. I was definitely sure that my next upgrade's gonna be the renowned G502 series.I was very excited when Logitech announced the new G502X but due to the pricing, I wanted to try the older G502 Hero first when it went on sale at $35 recently. The G502 Hero felt pretty similar to G402 in terms of ergonomics with small improvements in accessibility of side buttons. But I felt the mouse was heavy even without the weights and didn't like the metal scroll wheel. Even the RGB fun faded off just after a few hours and honestly found it distracting. (After 3 days of using).So I wanted to try the wired G502X as well and decided to return one of them at the end. After trying out the G502X, I felt the improvements addressed every shortcoming G502 Hero and G402 did for me.The new shape offers much better support to the left part of palm (Just below index finger) with some increased height there. The DPI shift button, the side buttons, especially the ones next to left click felt even more accessible and practical to use them more than ever before. The new switches feel more clicky, tactile and satisfying but needs a bit more effort to click. Should see how long these switch will last in the long run.The lightened scroll wheel with rubber grip feels more mature, the feel of ratcheted mode is lighter yet snappy and satisfying. Can assign custom scroll functions. And the overall aesthetic feels really mature and evolved, ready for the future.I usually have a mixture of palm and finger grip and the mouse perfectly fits in with the improvement in right part of the palm (Just below index finger) support and quickly got used to the feel of mouse (Usually a few minutes of break-in time). The skates are much larger and a huge step-up. The mouse glides much smoother which complements well with the lighter weight of mouse (Lighter than both G402 and G502 hero).But also, the wired G502X is expensive, no RGB but most notably the cable is a bit worrisome. I still would prefer the wired version just for the years of life one can squeeze out without worrying about battery wear.Finally, I returned the G502 Hero and am gonna use the G502X for the coming years. Despite the price, I don't regret it. It's an agile mouse with a ton of functionality. If you are upgrading from an older mouse like me or a lower-end/basic one, go directly for this. But if you're already happy with the older G502/similar, need for this mouse is much weaker and it's up to you.Thank you for reading so far. Happy holidays!",
        "This is an excellent mouse. It might not be the absolute best mouse for competitive gaming, but it still performs very well. Rtings ranks this as the \"best wired mouse\" which it absolutely deserves. Tracking is excellent and the ergonomics are great. The rubber grips are nicer and don't wear out quickly like my G403/G703 did. Given that it uses optical switches, I expect it to not start double-clicking like all my other Logitech mice, but we'll see about that.The best part about it is the amount of buttons and general utility it provides for non-gaming tasks. The scroll wheel unlocks and can spin at high speeds, and it can tilt left and right for horizontal scrolling. You have three thumb buttons, two extra buttons next to the left mouse button, and a middle button below the scroll wheel toggle. All of the buttons can be rebound, and you can also have an extra \"layer\" of buttons that can be switched to when a specific button is held (I use the \"sniper\" button for this). This means you get a ton of easily-accessible shortcuts which makes navigating web pages or documents very convenient.Some people consider wired mice \"outdated\" but never having to charge or worry about the battery or if your dongle has good reception is why I moved away from wireless. The cable is very thin and light so you barely notice it. There's also no RGB, which isn't a deal-breaker for me but some might find it disappointing.",
        "Key features and my initial impressions:Powerful Sensor: The Hero 25K sensor provides exceptional tracking accuracy and precision, even at high DPI settings.Customizable Buttons: The G502 X offers a variety of programmable buttons, allowing you to tailor the mouse to your specific gaming preferences.Comfortable Design: The contoured shape and textured grips provide a comfortable and secure grip, even during extended gaming sessions.However, I've encountered one minor issue: the DPI setting switch is a bit too sensitive. I've received numerous notifications about the DPI setting changing accidentally while using the mouse. This can be distracting and interfere with gameplay.I'll be updating this review in a few months to provide feedback on the mouse's durability. Given my history of burning through mice, I'm curious to see how the G502 X holds up over time.Overall, the Logitech G502 X is a capable gaming mouse with a few minor quirks. If you can overlook the sensitivity of the DPI switch, it's a solid choice for gamers seeking a high-performance mouse with customizable features."

        "After viewing 100's of rgb mouse pads, comparing features and prices, I decided to try this one...and I couldn't be happier with it!!!I was impressed by the size and the quality of the pad, very heavy with excellent non-slip rubber backing and super smooth on top.I chose the version with the 4 usb ports, very pleased with the quality of it. The lights around the outside edge of the pad are beautiful and bright, and has a ton of lighting modes and colors. All of this with an excellent value and a price that's unbelievably low.",
        "Purchased for 12-year old gamer, he loves the size, ease of movement with mouse, and of course the changing colors!  He has a matching mouse, and thinks that's the coolest!It does have to be plugged in to work, since it's not wireless, so you'll need an available USB port for it.So far, solid quality and value.  Will check bank in regarding longevity!",
        "There are dozens of these out there... many are simply re-branded items of the same thing. I like the secure magnetized phone charger and the material for the pad. The RGB is a great little distraction to liven up the table and the length/width is perfect for my 101-key Mac keyboard and mouse. Plenty of room, not too big to be overdone."

        "The Govee Smart LED Light Bars are an impressive choice for anyone looking to elevate their home ambiance. Compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant, these light bars offer seamless hands-free control for convenience. The vibrant color range and multiple preset scenes make them perfect for enhancing any space, whether used as background lighting for TV watching, gaming setups, or decorative room accents. The app control is intuitive, allowing customization of colors, brightness, and modes. The installation is straightforward, and the build quality feels durable. While the adhesive could be stronger for those wanting to mount them vertically, the overall performance and rich color output make these light bars a standout addition for modern, smart homes.",
        "After 3-4 months of using the Govee Smart LED Light Bars, they’ve added fantastic ambiance to my space. The lights sync easily with Alexa, making it effortless to adjust brightness, colors, and modes hands-free. The range of colors and customization options are impressive, and the setup is simple. They’re vibrant and versatile, perfect for enhancing any room or creating a personalized lighting experience.",
        "I don't have too much to add that hasn't already been mentioned. Setup was very simple, the app offers excellent control with plenty of customization, and the lights can go as bright or as dim as you'd like. I have mine set up behind a 32\" curved monitor and the adhesive mounts work perfectly. Worth mentioning, these are not compatible with the Corsair iCue system, but the control panel is easy to use and this wasn't a deal-breaker for me. The cables aren't too long so you won't be installing these too far from a power outlet. I also like the Google Home feature so I can just tell them to turn on with my pre-loaded settings. Weather I'm working on some new designs or gaming, these have really enhanced my workspace. I'll probably buy another set and put them to good use. For the price, these are a solid choice."

        "Let’s be honest: dealing with cable chaos can drive even the calmest person a little nuts. I had cables crawling across the floor, dangling off the desk, and sneaking behind the TV. It was a tripping hazard, an eyesore, and a constant reminder that I was not in control of my own home. That’s when I found this cable management kit, and my life (or at least my floor) hasn’t been the same since.First, let’s talk variety. This kit comes with more than enough clips, ties, and sleeves to tackle even the worst cable disaster zones. I didn’t just tidy up my workspace—I went through the entire house like a cable-cleaning crusader. Behind the TV? Handled. Under the desk? Sorted. Those stray wires near the kitchen counter? Gone. I still have supplies left over, and I’ve organized things I didn’t even know needed organizing.Using the kit was easier than I expected, too. The cable sleeves are flexible and fit neatly over cords, turning a chaotic jumble into a sleek, organized line. And the clips? These aren’t those flimsy clips that fall off after a day. They stick, they hold, and they don’t give up. Now, when I look at my desk or entertainment area, I don’t cringe—I smile. It looks like an actual grown-up lives here.On top of all that, my cables are safer. No more fraying or bending from getting tangled up. The protection these sleeves provide is the cherry on top of my new clutter-free, stress-free setup.If you’ve got a cable nightmare on your hands, this kit is the solution. It’s easy to use, works like a charm, and has completely transformed my home. I only wish I had found it sooner!",
        "Haven't really used much of this yet, but it's going to be very useful for policing the wires on my DJ gear when I set up. As a mobile DJ everything needs to be Small, loo good, function right and be easy to get put together in a short amount of time. These should help with this.  As long as the sticky glue holds well, I'll be very satisfied.",
        "This kit made cable management easier and neater for my desk. I would have given 5 stars, but some of the cable organizers just aren’t practical and some of the organizers for the bigger cords can not support the weight of the bigger cords they are supposed to hold. The adhesives on two of the organizers for the larger cords gave away after just a couple days and were no longer useable as a result."

        "I use these for call of duty and youtube some times my oculus 2. The rgb works with a smooth fade out loop although it's not addressable rgb it's pretty nice they even send adapters so it you want to power the rgb when your on xbox or ps5 it's independent from the controller power source (batteries) for pc you can just hook it up.Con the volume and mute switch on mine usually faces inward not a huge problem but sometimes moving around with raise or lower the volume a minor inconvenience if I would have designed it one would be on each side instead.Pros decent sound quality yesterday it saved me from being shot from behind in cod mw 2.0 the surround sound is decently crisp. The company is eager to please to to make sure you like it by the time I got it and started using it after a week they were checking up on how I liked it. After a couple messages back and forth he/she told me about the rgb being independent from the jack. Most of the rgb wired headphones I've seen aren't separated and only work on the pc. Now even watching TV (I have a projector) I can use the rgb. Microphone works as it should noise canceling I never hear complains from other players. The top fabric for comfort is comfortable I'm keeping the plastic they package it with to keep it clean. Each ear side get an addition inch approximately of length for people with bigger heads. The plastic ear cuffs are not going to flex unless to beat it with a heavy object the head band has just enough flex to it. And the microphone can be moved as it's flexible but also turned all the way pointing up . The head jack and usb splitter is pretty long about 6ft or so and it comes with a quality velcro cord piece to roll up for non use meaning if you wanted to you could put it on a headphone stand and hide the cords from you cat so it's not dangling.Suggestions to the company slightly thicker ear cups would be nice I got big ears so they kinda touch the inner fabric of the cuff and if I squeeze a little bit there's a little but of suction in my ears. Change the volume scrolling wheel to a sliding one and put it opposite of the microphone mute switch.Possible issues sometimes the microphone doesn't register on cod mw 2.0. However this is more likely to be call of duty chat program than the headphones because it happened multiple times with other headphones as well."

        "Where to begin.Cosmetically, these headphones look awesome and are great quality. The plastic seems to be durable but overall could be a bit better 4/5The hub is amazing. Being able to put the headphones down and charge them whenever without needing a cord is a HUGE gamechanger. You can switch between PC, XBOX, PS5, and Bluetooth seamlessly. 5/5The audio is about as good as it gets for gaming headphones. Audiophiles will want to look towards actual studio headphones instead, as they headphones are really just means for game explosions and sound effects. 4/5Comfort - The stock earphones are wildly comfortable. Very soft and pleasant, and prevent the headaches some headphones can give you. You can also swap them out easily as they are magnetically attached. 5/5Overall, definitely worth the price tag. 5/5",
        "Look no further if you, like me, needed a wireless pair of headphones for gaming across PC and console (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch). This device makes it effortless to switch between them all, and even still pair a phone or other device via Bluetooth at the same time.Functionality is fantastic! Fit is just like the pair of Astros you already have. Battery life is fantastic, and makes the value of the headset really shine. These are comfy, designed well for ease of use, and all the other things you want from a headphone.Last but not least, the sound is top notch. You get hires audio on PC, and great lossless audio on console. The kicker is the automatic Dolby Atmos and the partnership with better integration via Microsoft devices.The new Logitech G hub integration gives just a touch more control than the older Astro Command Center. Community EQ profiles are great addition!",
        "I have the A50 Gen 4 and the audio is top notch, but was lacking Bluetooth. Bought the A50 Gen 5, which is Logitech's official label, and I am not disappointed with the quality and audio performance of this headset. I am able to connect to multiple platforms, but I mainly use them on the PC. The best feature is the simultaneous source audio and Bluetooth!! This headset is very versatile when it comes to feature access. The same features on PC/Mac can be accessed on the phone app when using Xbox, PS, or Switch.I love that I can use my current 3rd party ear cushions from my Gen4s on this headset.I have had no issues with my Gen4s, and I assume to have the same experience with the Gen5s.Audio fidelity is a personal preference, and that is why I don't emphasize on that topic. So, it is my opinion that the audio on these headphones are one of the best that I have heard. The microphone is broadcast quality and can be adjusted to your liking.Battery life is as advertised and expected.Try them for yourself, My guess is that you will be very satisfied with this headset."

        "I like everything about it. It adjusts in several configurations. It holds my tablet, even though it's in a case. There's a space for cord to connect when phone is sitting on it, so it doesn't inhibit charging while it is on the stand. There is a hole on back to thread the cord through, I guess that is to stabilize it. It is versatile. The base and the support panel are plastic. The retractable support is aluminum. There is silicone on the support panel and anti-slip pads on the base. It says the base weighs180g. The whole unit weighs 253g.",
        "I bought this quite a few yrs ago and it served me so well. It is incredibly well made. Thoughts went into function quality. It broke due to my fault. I saw 2 cheaper items not of this brand as they were well under this price. I tried the first but not stable enough to hold past a few uses. Could crack super easy. I saw a 2nd one (both generic brands) and tried that one. Better support but could not rotate the phone while watching it. I had no surprises with this one so I bought it again. What a difference in quality and appearance. I can swivel my phone now while using it. The pink is beautiful. The stable support is unmatched by most.  Not one single problem. Just a quality holder that you won't regret. By far, worth the money.. Not sure why anything under 4 or 5 stars would be given; there is nothing bad I have seen in either purchase. Just my opinion but honest.",
        "I’ve had the pleasure of incorporating the LISEN Cell Phone Stand into my daily routine for the last two weeks, and overall, I am very impressed with its diverse functionality, elegant design, and the durability it brings to the table. The stand has made multitasking a breeze and quickly became an indispensable part of my office setup. Given the extensive period over which I’ve tested it, under various conditions and for different devices, I feel quite comfortable bestowing upon it a well-deserved 4-star rating. I’d like to elaborate on multiple facets of this product that contribute to its overall high score.When it comes to phone stands in today’s digital age, these accessories are not just a convenience but, increasingly, a necessity. They serve as reliable bases for our smartphones or tablets during office Zoom meetings, or perhaps when we want to catch up on our favorite shows without holding the device. LISEN’s Cell Phone Stand seems tailor-made to fill this niche role in our digital lives, and for the most part, it does an outstanding job. Its overall aesthetic is modern and understated, making it a universal fit for any office or home environment. The sleek lines and the minimalistic design elements contribute to an air of professionalism and sophistication, making it a stand that you wouldn’t mind displaying prominently on your desk.Regarding the quality of the materials used in this product, it is immediately apparent that LISEN has opted for a premium build. The metal components are sturdy, offering the promise of lasting durability, which is of utmost importance for an item designed for daily use. In the long run, a durable build can make a significant difference, ensuring that the stand withstands the test of time and daily wear and tear.Now, let’s pivot towards performance, which is where the LISEN Cell Phone Stand truly shines. The articulating mechanisms for height and angle adjustments are impressively smooth and intuitive. This flexibility allows for a highly customizable viewing experience, from any angle and at varying distances. The stand lives up to its claim of being universally compatible by accommodating an extensive range of devices with different sizes and dimensions, thus fulfilling its promise effectively.One of the most commendable features of this stand is its durability, manifested in its exceptionally stable base. This ensures that there is no tipping or wobbling, even when the stand holds heavier devices. In other words, once you place your device on it, you can rest assured knowing it’s secure.👌 As far as fit goes, this stand is incredibly versatile. The holding grip is designed to securely accommodate devices ranging from 4 to 10 inches in size, without leaving any unsightly scratches or marks. This universal fit feature proves especially useful for families or individuals who own multiple devices of different dimensions.However, as is the case with any consumer product, the LISEN Cell Phone Stand isn’t entirely without its flaws. A minor issue I ran into involves the height adjustment knob, which at times, felt slightly resistant and required an extra push to lock securely into place. While this is a small drawback and not a deal-breaker by any means, it’s something that could be improved for an even smoother user experience.In summary, the LISEN Cell Phone Stand more than justifies its 4-star rating by offering a harmonious blend of aesthetic appeal, high-quality construction, superb performance features, and robust durability. While there are some minor issues, such as the height adjustment knob requiring a bit more force than expected to lock securely, these are easily overshadowed by its many positive aspects. If you are in the market for a versatile, reliable, and high-quality phone stand, I strongly recommend considering the LISEN Cell Phone Stand. Your search might just end here. Thank you for investing your time in reading this comprehensive review, and I hope it aids you in making an informed purchase decision."

        "I've needed something like this forever for the various headsets that I've owned over the years. It's such a simple, but very effective product that was at a good price point when I bought it. I like how it swivels so you can hang your headset under your desk, which is the configuration that I've chosen for mine. It's one of the best quality of life upgrades I've purchased in a long time, honestly. It has a built in cable clip for keeping your long headset cord tidy also, which I really like.",
        "I didn't realize it rotated 360 degrees when I ordered, so extra points for that!!!  It is an extremely solid and well built shelf hanger for my headset.  It will hold quite a bit of weight, and posesses a very sold clamp on a 3/4 inch shelf.  I especially like the little cord holder on the bottom to help keep the cord off my desk !  And it is an excellent value for the price.  Looks great, works great !",
        "Didn't want to keep laying my Headphones down on the table or on top of my PC. Neither did I want to get a Headphone stand - Since it's going to take more space and probably block my monitor view.I do have limited space on my computer desk as you can see. This product was perfect! Just thin enough to slide right under my PC with no issues and it was a quick and easy installation.It's super simple & I'm extremely happy with it - Dropping this review right immediately after. Got the package, opened it up and snapped it in place, as simple as that. My table isn't all that thick, yet it still holds perfectly and let me mention, VERY FIRM as well.Definitely recommend it, You can clearly have 2 headphones if needed. Thanks! 5/5"

        "These are super cheap and awesome (comes with 2 pairs). They do exactly as advertised and look good. If you need a pair just grab these and don't think about it. Pick a set of colors you like and there you go. They are a strong thin plastic structure that fits well. They also come with a test light to show you how they block the blue light which is very cool to see that they work. You should lessen your eye strain with these like I have.",

I have been using these mousepads for a long time, and I am always impressed by their durability, thickness, and overall quality.The thickness is one of the standout characteristics of the QcK mouse pad. The QcK mouse pad is designed to be durable, unlike flimsy ones that wear out easily. The durable fabric construction creates a solid surface that allows my mouse to smoothly glide, ensuring accurate and seamless movements while gaming.I recently made the choice to purchase an additional QcK mouse pad for my work station, and I am extremely satisfied with my decision. Having it on my desk not only adds a professional touch but also boosts my productivity with its comfortable and reliable surface for my mouse.I have several QcK mouse pads spread out on my desk at home, and I can't imagine using any other kind.

This must-have accessory is perfect for gamers and professionals, thanks to its XXL size, thick cloth construction, and unmatched durability. I strongly recommend this!",
        "I have been putting off getting a mousepad for a while, when a friend recommended this one. It has excellent quality, and unlike other mouse pads I've had, it is nice and grippy so it stays put. Most importantly, it tracks my mouse perfectly! My mouse was sometimes not receiving inputs due to a lack of mouse pad, previous mouse pads also would have mistracks. The material is smooth and glidey. I love the size!",
        "I've been a dedicated gamer for years, and I can confidently say that the SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad is a game-changer in every sense. This mouse pad is an absolute beast when it comes to optimizing your gaming experience. Here's why I give it a solid 5/5 rating:1.

        "As a bluetooth speaker this isn't anything special (it's  equivalent to a $20-30 BT speaker I'd say), but the LED display is excellent for a 16x16 display. This is a rather low-res display, so it's really only suitable for displaying some very basic information like time and temperature, but the main feature is the ability to display feeds of pixel art animations or whatever animations you manually select.This might seem a bit childish, but it's not really any different than any other small table art piece except that it's more in the trendy and goofy category rather than classical.It also has a music \"visualizer\" that's pretty simple. I think it just switches between 16 different images based on amplitude of the audio, but the nice thing about that is that anyone can draw their own visualizer by just creating 16 images.Anyway, this is good for kids and for adults wanting something nerdy or LED-flashy and the quality is pretty good.",
        "The device looks great and is fun to use out of it just being an alarm clock.Pros: it's good value for what you get. It looks great and grabs the attention of my guest. I wish I had the bigger one. Sound is good as well when I connect it to Bluetooth.Cons: I think the app needs an update to make finding certain images easier but that's just me nitpicking. It's a great device and this business has the potential to get popular if it gets even more fun and wacky with these devices, as long as they stay updated and creative with its future releases.",
        "I love this speaker!  The way it shows whatever you want on it its amazing.  The battery lasts the whole day while showing graphics and the sound is good.  Great product and good price.  Thank you!"

        "Edit: wifi connection sucks. It would connect for a little bit, the won't receive signal. It will keep you connected to wifi, but will act as if you have no internet. I keep my wifi off for best data performance, which is great for me. For those looking to stay connected to wifi, this may be a deal breaker. I've looked on Reddit and this seems to be an issue with the 8 series. Hopefully it gets patched, but considering it's been over 6 months, it's unlikely.I left Android for iPhone about 5 years ago, and I always missed the freedom Android gave me. The \"major\" updates Apple gave had been old features for Android. Recently, I fell in a rabbit hooe searching for Android gaming devices, and decided between this and the Samsung 23 Ultra.I got the 23 Ultra, and instantly fell in love, but the Red Magic 8 Pro was my first pick, as a gaming (emulation) was my priority, so I returned the 23 and grabbed the Translucent 8 Pro. While the 23 Ultra is the better feature rich phone, the 8 Pro is a gaming beast.First, I tested Genshin Impact, and while it performs better on iPhone 13 Pro Max (on Medium settings), this phone plays great with MAX setting when you set the in phone game mode settings to rise and the fan is blasting. To get great gameplay without compromising resolution and frame rate AND not having your phone turn into a piece of hot coal after 20 minutes is a absolut win for me. Mapping touch screen buttons to a controller definitely is a negative, as the performance is massively noticeable, compared to iOS native controller support, but that's a small price to pay for gaming freedom. I used the GameSir X2 (Bluetooth) for every phone.As mentioned earlier, my main reason for switching is freedom, and part of that is emulation without hacking (jailbreaking) my phone. I downloaded everything from NES to GameCube, GameBoy to 3ds, and this is where the Red Magic 8 Pro 16gb version outclasses the 23 Ultra. Right of the bat, every game I tested looked and performed better.With Mario 3D Land, the 23 Ultra played decently with 2x resolution  (\"chugged\" here and there) while the Red had the same performance at 4x resolution on Rise mode. Dropped it to 3x and Balanced, and it played PERFECTLY. Visually, there is almost no difference in visuals between 3x and 4x on the phone, and was only able to tell them apart when I zoomed in on the screenshots I took to compare the different resolutions (from 2x to 4x).I won't explain every test I did (which took about 3 hours), but the one that impressed me most was God of War Ghost of Sparta. I was able to play that with 10x resolution on the 8 Pro on Balance mode with as if it was running at 1x resolution, while it became almost unplayable around 6x on the 23 ultra. Those gaming features truly make a difference.As for the other basic functions, some are serviceable, some are great. Calls on speaker are lower than when music plays. The music sounds great and loud to me (better than 13 Pro Max), but calls over the speaker sound like whisper in comparison. In a quiet room, any external noise would easily down out the call. Off of speaker, it sound loud and clear.Music is awesome. Streaming through Amazon Music (cuz the stupid app won't let me download and listen on another app, nor transfer out), the phone is surprisingly loud and clear. I didn't notice any distortion or unbalancing issues with the bass, and I definitely enjoyed listening through this phone than I did on the iPhone and Samsung. The fact that it has a headphone jack may not matter if you have Bluetooth headphones, but now you can tell people to \"pass the aux cord\" XD.The camera is surprisingly nice, considering it's primarily a gaming phone. The 13 Pro Max took some great pictures and videos, and the 23 Ultra blew that out of the water, but while the Red 8 Pro can't compete with them in a side by side comparison, they look great on their own. When you inevitably take a video or picture, you WILL be satisfied and impressed with how great they came out considering photography is not why you would consider this phone over something mainstream.Last, and certainly not least; this charges FAST AS HELL! In about 5 minutes, you'll gain about 20%. In about 30 minutes, you'll go from 2% to 90%. It doesn't matter how fast this phone dies (this WILL last you all day with moderate use) if you can charge it to 100% in such a short time. Unfortunately, it doesn't have wireless charging, but with charging speeds (65w) like this, I wouldn't use it, anyway.Tl;dr:If you want the best gaming experience on your primary phone, get the 16gb Red Magic 8 Pro.",
        "2nd UPDATE on 8/7/2024:Somebody asked if the Redmagic 9S Pro was compatible for Bend Oregon? To begin with, I have a 8S pro, the model before. I have not heard of ANY incompatibility issues. I have T-mobile and it works perfectly. It has a double sim tray and I could have 2 phone numbers on it if I wanted. I still don't game, but I use it extensively to watch videos and run my Powerpoint presentations (in Google Slides). Everything runs perfectly, and extremely fast, never a gliche. I know my phone is over-powered for what I do, but it's like owning a Lamborghini to run everyday errands. And the battery is the best thing. I still charge my phone every 3 days, and I use it a lot. I also use my standard 3.5mm phone jack a lot too and would have gotten it for that one thing. The antenna is great, never a gliche using google maps. It is just an awesome phone. I worried that it's 6.8\" size might be too big, but with a slim case, the thin phone fits easily in the front pockets of my jeans. I assume the 9S pro is the same or better.UPDATE ON 3/24/2024:This phone is amazing for what I need. Most amazing is the 6 amp hour battery that never seems to run out. I used to charge my old phone every day, sometimes twice a day. I charge the new redmagic phone every 3 days (still at 20%), and it only takes 18 minutes to fully charge! That one thing alone makes it worth the  money. It is extremely fast for video & powerpoint files, and the usb3.2 jack allows me to connect to my PC and easily and quickly move big files back and forth. You don't need to play games to make good use of an extremely powerful phone.INITIAL REVIEW:First I'm not a gamer, but I need a powerful phone with big screen, USB3.0 or better data transfer and most of all, a 3.5mm headphone jack! This has it all. It has an awesome big screen with graphics subprocessor system that makes it extremely fast, which wasn't absolutely necessary, but it plays my powerpoint files breathtakingly fast. The USB 3.2 connector connects easily to my PC because it is important for me to transfer large data files to and from the phone. It works great. It has 12GB ram and 256GB rom, the minimum for this phone. That is more than I need but you can upgrade to much more memory and storage. I use the 3.5mm headphone jack nearly every day to play music and videos, and absolutely would not have a phone without one. The BATTERY is a monster. It has two 3,000 mah batters totaling 6,000 mah. What that means is the way I use it, I only have to charge it every 3 days! And after I run it down below 20%, it recharges all the way to full in about 15 minutes. Amazing. I had heard that the camera wasn't the best, but it is plenty good for me. It has Sony lenses and takes great photos and videos, in high resolution if you want, and even has a pro mode for mini picture adjustments that I will never do. And it costs literally half what a flagship samsung or iphone cost, half. I cannot comment on games which this phone was designed for, because I don't play games. The simple cheap case I bought for it looks sleek and great. The only possible negative is that it's heavy, because of the huge battery that lasts forever. SUMMARIZING: this is one awesome phone that any older non-gamer will be thrilled to own. BTW, I am a simple consumer, I don't work in the tech field.",
        "First of all, yes, this is a gaming phone, with that being said they design of the phone lets people know that; however, the most standout aspects of the gamer niche design does not scream when compared with other typical devices! The size of this phone is incredible and feels great in hands, big or small thanks to it's boxy body. While lacking wireless charging, it is arguable that the whopping 80 Watt charging (which the charger is included with purchase) makes up by getting from 0 - 100 % in roughly 30-40 minutes! On top of this the need to constantly charge is not necessary thanks to its 6,500 maH battery. The specs is astonishing when examining price aswell, it could easily be classified as midrange in price, but flagship in hardware! Great buy!P.S. for you emulators out there, yes it can run modern games native or within winulator at 20-40 fps depending on configs!"

        "I got this as a gift for my dad and he LOVES it. It is part of his computer setup and the graphics are very customizable. I got this on sale, but still would've purchased even if it was full price. Worth your money and makes a great clock. Very cool and futuristic look.",
        "...but barely.  It's beautiful. Feels well made. Attention to detail. It's definitely overpriced for what it is, but I don't take a star away because I knew the price beforehand and it loved up to the quality I was expecting, but it is still overpriced.Also, no battery.  I almost took a star off for that. It's insane that it doesn't.  Power goes out, why wouldn't a clock have a battery to keep working a while?And the software, I haven't figured out how to get it to do what I want, but still not taking off a statement because the app has a lot of features I didn't expect,  but I haven't figured out how to do what I want, which is to have it cycle through a number of custom setups.  You can make 5 different profiles but you can't tell it to cycle through those 5.  But, inside each profile you can make it cycle.So, for example, it has 5 screens. If you want each screen to cycle through 5 different things, like a picture, the time, a stock price, a pixel art, and a weather.  You can do that for all 5 screens so that this single profile cycles through 5 different things on each screen.I can make 5 of those but if I want to cycle through those 5, which would effectively be 25 different things displayed in each screen, you can't do that. You pick one of the profiles you made and it will cycle through the images / widgets you picked.I probably  didn't explain that well.Anyway, it's really cool.  I'm debating putting it inside my PC if I can get it to display water temp or flow rate.",
        "No this is actually very nice even if a little pricey. I expected a tad more of functionality and software support since that boom has been at this for a while. Still can't say I'm really disappointed. As long as you see what it looks like before you buy it and that's what you want you'll be happy. I had much more pictures smart screen functionality on the little ips's, but they don't necessarily mislead you I just had an higher expectation. No I use it it's very nice it's very pretty."

        "I can't even begin with how excited I am to have this controller stand - and I don't even play a lot of video games!! 😅The hand has amazing details and the paint is so realistic! Very sturdy, holds the weight on the controller and the headphones well, and doesn't try to tip over easily. As you can see in my pics, it's a little bigger than my actual hand, but still a realistic size.I've been looking at this for almost a year, before I decided to go ahead and buy it - considering I don't play console video games enough to actually need something like this... but since I kept coming back to it, I knew I was going to get it to match my mood and current decor of my space. I'm so happy that I got it. 😊If you're on the fence about buying it, I can tell you that you won't regret owning it.",
        "I did not expect such a high quality product for the price! It is solid, sturdy, perfect weight, works as expected, and looks fantastic. It is roughly the size of an adult males hand and arm. Packaged beautifully and no assembly required!",
        "Very impressed.  Built sturdy. Larger than expected but perfect. Really much nicer in person that on line.  It’s weighted so your controller and headset sit solid on it with no chance of tipping. Makes my nightstand look great instead of having my headset and controller flopped out on it. Highly recommend it if it’s your thing."

        "I’m somewhat of an audiophile; I have higher end home audio, headphones, etc. I don’t game often so I figured I’d grab a cheap pair and update if necessary cuz I really only needed a mic… but I’m very impressed with the build quality, comfort, ease of use and intuitive and functional use of this headset.I was gaming in the 360 days where just any old corded headset could plug into your controller and be fine. These have Bluetooth capability or it comes with a USB for an automatic connection that’s just seemless. They get loud, sound clean and crisp and well rounded with good, deep bass, rich and clear sound.. not muddy. I’m honestly incredibly impressed. They look nice too.",
        "Beautifully built. Sturdy and comfortable. The colour is so cool and the accent light gives it a pop. Performance is outstanding for me as I use it with my PS5, cell phone and also to watch TV. Also the sound is really good. Pairing is so easy as the device shows up immediately to pair to the connecting device. Sound dampening is not bad either. Price point for this quality headphones is great.",
        "The 2.4GHz Wireless Gaming Headset has truly impressed me with its superior sound quality and comfort. As an avid gamer, the immersive stereo sound enhances my experience in games like Fortnite and Call of Duty, providing a competitive edge with clear and detailed audio. The 2.4GHz wireless connection is seamless, delivering uninterrupted sound without lag.Comfort is crucial for long gaming sessions, and this headset excels in that area. The plush ear cups fit perfectly, offering excellent noise isolation without causing discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a snug fit, allowing for hours of use without fatigue.Versatility is another standout feature. The headset works flawlessly across multiple platforms, including PS5, PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch, and the Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity makes it easy to use with mobile devices. The built-in microphone is clear and effective, enhancing communication during online gaming. Additionally, the sleek design, sturdy build, and impressive battery life make this headset a top choice for any gamer."

        "These are one of the most comfortable headphones that I ever used. Not only does it not cause any discomfort when i wear it for prolonged periods of time, but it also helps to tune out and reduce background noised despite not being noise canceling. also i found that most headphones tend to be too big for my head size, however these perfectly fit. Also the mic is amazing I had used the mic in many different environments such as BF connection with my phone while on call, or usb connecting on my computer for conference call and even gaming, it works well in all environments. Lastly believe that it work better if not out perform in general compare to other headset costing $80 or more. So it general you are paying less and getting more for your money.",
        "I recently purchased the Ozeino 2.4GHz Wireless Gaming Headset with Microphone, and it has truly transformed my gaming experience! From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed with the sleek and sturdy design, which hints at the high-quality performance it delivers.**Connectivity:** The dual 2.4G USB and Type C transmitters make it incredibly versatile. Whether I'm using my PC, console, or even my smartphone, the connection is seamless and instantaneous. The wireless range is impressive, allowing me to move freely around my gaming space without any loss in audio quality.**Sound Quality:** The audio is crystal clear with deep bass and sharp highs, making every in-game sound come to life. The surround sound feature provides an immersive experience, helping me pinpoint the direction of footsteps or gunfire, giving me a competitive edge.**Comfort:** The headset is extremely comfortable, even during extended gaming sessions. The cushioned ear cups and adjustable headband ensure a perfect fit, reducing pressure on my ears and head. I can game for hours without feeling any discomfort.**Microphone:** The built-in microphone is another standout feature. It delivers clear voice communication with my teammates, free from static or background noise. The flexible mic boom allows for easy adjustment, ensuring my voice is always picked up perfectly.**Battery Life:** The battery life is exceptional, easily lasting through long gaming marathons. The quick charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing me to get back into the game quickly if I ever forget to charge it overnight.Overall, the Ozeino 2.4GHz Wireless Gaming Headset with Microphone is a fantastic investment for any gamer. It combines high-quality audio, comfort, and versatility into one impressive package. Highly recommended!",
        "For the price these are a surprisingly good set of headphones. Sound is great. They are fairly light but feel solid. They are way more comfortable than I thought they would be. I was worried about the microphone being in the way, but it folds back into a little slot when you're not using it. The RGB isn't anything special, and I can't enjoy the lights when wearing them so not sure it's a big selling feature. Easy plug and play on my computer as well as my PS5."

        "I'm a HUGE fan of \"low-end\" turtle beach headsets, and I bought these to replace an aging pair of Ear Force PLa's that had served me faithfully for a long time (and still function very well, albeit thanks to a ton of tape work on damage I caused myself stupidly). Considering I paid only ten dollars more for these, the difference is staggering.As others note, they're not a top end headset, but for $40, do you really expect that? Sound is clear and crisp. Mic is clear and loud, without being overly sensitive (and the windscreen performs very well), and connects/disconnects easily... I'm actually using Dragon to type this with the mic in my laptops mic port! Some complain that the mic is inflexible, but I haven't found a position yet that it won't accept and stay with. I do, however, wish they had used the jacketing from the PLa line (ribbed, semi-metallic covering that allowed for total freedom of position) instead of the semi-hard, plastic-feeling overmold on this one.Leather-feel ear cups are VERY well designed and generously padded, they feel very natural on my head and surround my ear with an almost hermetic seal... pressing on the sides of the cups while wearing them yields a noticeable increase in pressure in my ears (you probably shouldn't do this).Entire system is very light (due in part to plastic construction, which doesn't come off feeling as \"cheap\" as other plastic headsets).At 4ft, the cord doesn't give a ton of room, but it was designed to be used with a console controller audio jack, so it doesn't need it... but for use with an mp3 player or laptop, it's great for those that don't need the extra length getting in the way.Some cons:In-line volume/mic control is small and hard to grasp (almost too smooth), and in turn, the volume control knob is very narrow and set deeply in the control box. When you do locate the volume blindly, it's somewhat difficult to roll, but I'm going to assume it will loosen in time. I would suggest moving it closer to the wire's splitter to make it easier to locate blindly, but it's a personal preference some may disagree with.The mic only inserts into the headset in one direction, having a cut out on the mic itself that must be aligned with a tab on the mic jack. It's difficult, though not impossible, to insert it while wearing the headset, so I suggest you choose in or out before you begin using them. I see no reason why this design had to be implemented, and hope future models will omit it.The connecting band has very little in the way of padding across the top of your head. It's not only a very small fill, but it's the same low density, very soft foam used in the ear cups, making it almost ineffective. It's not uncomfortable once you get the fit right for your head (though mine is shaved, your mileage may vary), but it still seems no thought at all went into this design point. Increasing the fill or using a higher density foam could fix this in future models.Each ear cup is connected to one half of the wire, which I personally don't enjoy the feel of, though its double connection design does prevent a lot of twisting that could lead to a single wire design pulling out of it's grommet. The wire(s) itself is very soft and flexible, which while offering comfort, I'm afraid would be easily abraded or pinched.All in all, you would be hard pressed to find another headset that offers more or performs better at or near this price point...it may even be an impossibility. Though PLa's are cheaper and more than adequate, for any looking for an entrance point into the headset market, these are without a doubt the only headset I will ever recommend again. If you need higher performance, just move up the price scale in the turtle beach line, each offering will blow you away.",
        "For this price point, I can't say anything less than 5 stars for this headset. I was originally going to go with a different product until seeing that the Ear Force Recon 50(X) series, was to release on 9/25/15. I decided to give it a try, and figured why not. For $40 it seemed like a steal!For the most part, it is a steal.PROS:--The headset itself is good looking, at first I thought the green would be a little off-putting compared to the color of my other accessories and peripherals, but it actually looks really great. Of course, this part is subjective.--Very lightweight. This thing only weighs a few ounces, and other than the light sensation of the cups on your ears, you could not even know you have it on.--The mic is detachable, which is awesome.--Further, the mic sounds great. It picks up my voice with a pretty good clarity for an entry-level gaming headset, and the attached covering of the mic essentially works as a pop filter. In fact, I have a fan blowing right by me and it manages to cancel the vast majority of the wind rushing into it from the fan. Solid mic.--The sound is pretty good. Bass and highs are on par for this price point, with the mids being the weakest link of the sound stage. For music and movies it is probably not the best choice, although it would still work more than adequately for those uses. Gaming is where it really shines, and the sound quality is more than good enough for my gaming needs. Footsteps are defined, gunshots and explosions sound great, and voices and dialog sound just fine.--Adaptability and Connectivity: It connects to the Xbox One controller that has the 3.5mm plug-in, and works on any Xbox One controller with the Turtle Beach or Microsoft headset adapter. My controller has the plug directly on it, so it works flawlessly without the need of an adapter. Further, it includes an adapter to change the mic/headphones to two separate plugs and I tested it on my PC and it works great for both sound and mic as well. Even though it is marketed as an Xbox One headset, it works just fine on PC and my iPhone. I don't have a PS4 to try it on, but I would imagine it would work just fine.CONS:--Like mentioned above, the sound is pretty much on par. Nothing special and certainly doesn't blow your mind with audio fidelity. However for this price range I can't imagine it gets much better. Mids could be a bit better with frequency range.--The cord is rather short. Granted, this model is targeted specifically towards the Xbox One, so plugging it into the controller with the cord length is more than enough, and nice because you don't have a huge bundle of cord on your lap when it is plugged into your controller. However, for use with a PC or other device you might need to purchase a 4 pole 3.5mm extension cable to make it a bit longer. I managed to find several on Amazon for a few bucks, so if this is a problem for you I would recommend going the extension cable route instead of disregarding this headset.OVERALL:I rated 5, but would probably give closer to a 4.5. For $40 (current price at time of writing, the day this headset has been released), it is a great deal. I am very happy with it, and use it as my main headset for my Xbox now, and a backup for my PC. Very comfortable, lightweight, sound is more than adequate in terms of quality, and it works with a multitude of devices. For gaming, it is just an all-around great entry-level headset.",
        "This is being written on the first day after receiving this product. This Turtlebeach headset has great audio quality from the headphones an dmic, though the latter has a bit of an echo when it's too close to your mouth. It's poseable and I don't get that effect around 4-7 inches away from my mouth. The mic is also detachable. The instructions are surprisingly good, particularly for people who aren't computer saavy. They mention a splitter cable that doesn't come with the model I ordered, (The 50P model) or the 50x model, only the standard Recon 50 Model.I've tested it in a dell optiplex 5060sff as well as my HP laptop, which both only have a single jack for audio. In the former thanks to the Wavemaxx Audio Pro I  can choose what the headset is recognized s, mere headphones, a headset, speakers, a mic only, etc. The laptop has no such functionality, but will recognize the audio in and out from both headphones and mic all the same. Only it will play the audio of your own voice on the headphones, so be aware if you're planning on using this headset with a laptop.As well, the mic is very strong in that it can pic up a TV at moderate volume from about eight feet away.I bought it for use in voice chatting, recording, and chatting during video games. Unfortunately the cord is VERY SHORT. Far too short for me to uncomfortably use on my PC without being too close to the screen. I'm going to try and utilize my PS4 controller for this and will update whether or not it works."

The LED functions look good and are easy to access and change. I wish it were compatible with LED control software, but I'm sure that would be way more expensive.",
        "I bought this for my 10yr old gamer. He loves the “clicky” tactile response to key strokes. It performs well and the light effects are awesome! He spilled soda on it immediately (why, because he’s 10! lol) and we discovered that the typewriter style keycaps and cases were pretty easy to clean. I would recommend this to anyone lookin to for a cool, “clicky”, flashy keyboard.",
        "Great keyboard, all the lights are the talk of the office as is the retro feel and look. That of an old typewriter, for me the chunky buttons took getting used to, but that’s personal! This keyboard looks and feels good, oh and clicks…. That’s important right?"

        "If you’re tired of crawling under your desk to plug in gadgets or wrestling with tangled cords, this Jgstkcity Desk Clamp Power Strip is a lifesaver. I was looking for a sleek, convenient solution for keeping my workspace powered up, and this thing delivers big time.First off, the clamp system is fantastic. It fits snugly on my 1.96-inch desktop edge without leaving a single scratch, and it’s sturdy enough that I don’t worry about it wobbling or slipping. Installation? A breeze. Just clamp it on, plug it in, and you’re set.With three outlets and two USB-C ports (each pumping out 20W PD for fast charging), it handles everything from my laptop to my phone, tablet, and even a desk lamp without breaking a sweat. The 40W charging power is no joke—I can get my phone juiced up in record time. Add in the 6FT flat plug cord, and it’s long enough to reach outlets even in awkward spots.It’s perfect for home or office use, and the surge protection gives me peace of mind knowing my devices are safe. Plus, the design is clean and compact, so it doesn’t clutter up my desk.If you need desktop power that’s functional, efficient, and easy to use, this is it. Highly recommend!",
        "Works as intended. Plugs are spaced well and allow for wide adapters. Plugs are oriented such that the cord drops behind the power bar/ desk.  Liked it so much I bought a second for the other side of my desk.",
        "I like this unit as its easy to install and seems to work just fine.  I think there is a limitation on the usb ports but i have not really played with the usb ports enough to say for sure.  My only issuue is the way the cord comes out the back as my desk is pushed tight to the wall.  I wish it had a 90 degree end where it comes out of the block."

        "The GMMK 2 is an upgrade in all respects from the original GMMK. I really like the 96% layout since it feels like a TKL board but has a number pad.It's VERY quiet out of the box and the linear switches are smooth and nice to type on or game on.I generally prefer tactile switches (like Cherry MX Brown or Glorious Panda) but the Red Fox linear switches the GMMK2 comes with are very nice.The software and driver are functional. Not great but they work fine.You can set the input lag to 0ms, 8ms, or 16ms (it defaults to 16ms). Higher will avoid key chatter, lower will tighten up input lag.RGB lighting is very bright and there are numerous choices for patterns and the option of setting per key.Of note: There are 3 layers you can define settings for in the Glorious software. This includes macros and lighting settings for each layer. Hotkeys are definable to swap/cycle layers.It's a very nice keyboard, much better than it's predecessor (which is now discounted significantly).It may not measure up to some of the higher end custom build keyboards that are available through group buys or Drop, but it gets pretty close. Like, real close.Alternatively, you can look at the Keychron Q2 which would be a smaller keyboard with a knob. Build quality is slightly higher but so is the price.The GMMK Pro is also an option (again, smaller layout). But I would advise waiting to see if they port over some of the enhancements from the GMMK 2 to a new version of the Pro before buying one of those.TLDR; It's a great keyboard. Feels nice, sounds good, customizable if you want to change it later on. And the price is right. I like it.",
        "I wanted a 100% keyboard and found the GMMK 3.  I liked the white color (not for everyone, but why do all the keyboards need to be black?) and realized there are a lot of customizations I could add (will look into that later - keycaps probably first).  I have now been using for about 24 hours and I am extremely happy with the keyboard.  I really like he click feel (Fox switches are the standard).  It has grown on me (not naturally into the click sound) over the years and these hit the right level for me (I don't understand all the ways that people describe switches, I just know I like these - seem pretty straight forward).  The build quality is solid and the included keycaps are pretty nice (will change them because I want to put more of a unique feel to the board).Overall I highly recommend.  I went with the 100% as I wanted the numpad, if I didn't I would have gone with the 75%.Oh, and it looks good on my black large mousepad, though I am considering switching that to a white mousepad (just worried about how often I would need to clean it).",
        "TLDR;I researched for weeks to find the quietest mechanical keyboard under $150 and this was the winner. Quiet, responsive, solid build, backlit AND readable in the dark, and built-in memory for macros/button customization. LED customization so it doesn't have to look so \"gamer-y.\"Excellent keyboard for the price! Pre-built was the most cost-effective way to go since it included the Fox linear switches. I originally purchased it thinking I would switch them to gateron browns, but the I actually really like the Fox switches. They are very responsive and very quiet! I needed something less clicky for when I was working from home because the logitch mx blue switches drove my wife crazy. Since I was using this for gaming and work, I wanted it compact with a numpad. The GMMK 2 delivered! It's only ~2\" longer than most TKL boards and has enough separation between the arrows and numpad that I don't typo. The keyboard did have a little bit of a learning curve with a smaller (1u) 0 key on the numpad, but after this adjustment it's been great. The Glorious software allows you to full customize the keyboard LEDs, button functions, and macros. There's no dedicated Home button, so I was able to re-bind a key to do it.  Another plus is this is a great beginner keyboard for those wanting to get into modding. I changed the keycaps to PBT and rubberized caps and made the keyboard even quieter and \"thoccy\" by doing the \"foam mod,\" \"bandaid mod,\" and adding O-ring. Rubberized arrow keycaps made for more textural separated to prevent typos even more."

        "I used to enjoy racing games until they became so realistic that it basically required a steering wheel to actually enjoy. I decided to finally purchase a wheel, pedals, and shifter to see if it would be something I’d like. After spending a couple of days with my homemade setup that consisted of lots of spare wood and clamps, i realized I needed more stability. Still getting a feel for sun-racing and not wanting to waste my money I bought this stand as it worked with my setup, a Logitech G920.It works and I am happy. That’s the big thing. Now I have a place to put all of this extra stuff and it’s not in the way. You can fold it up with the pedals and wheel still attached, but it’s not fitting under your bed like that. Especially not with the shifter. Which doesn’t matter since it’s super easy to put together. So taking the wheel and shifter attachment off is not big deal. You can easily store it with the pedals still attached, which is great since screwing the pedals on was the hardest part. “Hardest” is a relative term.Pros:- Well made for the price. Everything is firm and sturdy, nothing feels cheap. For the price I was expecting it to be cheap, but no, this thing is solid and much heavier than I thought it would be.- comes with all the hardware necessary to attach steering wheel, pedals, and shifter. I assume the bolts they use are industry standard. It was very nice when I realized the extra hardware was for the accessories and I didn’t need to buy anything else.- very versatile. You have many options in terms of angle and height- easy to assemble, comes with tools and hardware- comes with Velcro bands to keep all your wires nice and neat. I was quite shocked with this one. It would have been a disaster waiting to happen if I just left all the wiring hanging all over the place. It seems the company thought of this and decided to take care of their costumers.- between the weight, the footprint of the base, and the adjustable legs under the stand, this stand is not moving unless you want to move it. I have braked as hard as I could and the stand didn’t move forward.- comes with stationary casters for your gaming chair. Remove the wheels under your gaming chair and install the flat replacements that are provided. Now you don’t have to worry about rolling backward every time you press on the brake pedal.- comes with 2 caster wheels to make the stand easy to transport when you’re done with it. After you’re done for the day just fold it up and wheel it back to where you store it. No need to pick it up and lug it back and forth.Cons- unable to connect shifter arm when lowering the wheel table to its lowest setting. Which is not even a big deal really since it is plenty low with the shifter. Lowest height with shifter arm attached 25” and lowest height without shifter arm is 22”. This is the height measured from the floor to the top of the wheel platform.- no way to ‘upgrade’. I am using a computer chair for now, but if I want to upgrade to a sim-racing seat there is no upgrade available for this setup.Overall I am very pleased with this product. If I had to do it all over again I would buy this one. If you’re like I was - on the fence and not sure if you’re ready to sink $1000 into a ‘beginner’ setup - then you really won’t be disappointed in this stand.",

        "The EasySMX X15 PC Controller boasts an attractive price tag, making it a tempting option for budget-minded gamers seeking a wired controller for their PC. While it offers a decent level of functionality, it's important to understand that it comes with certain compromises.**Pros:*** **Affordable:** The X15 is a budget-friendly option, making it accessible to a wider range of gamers.* **Wired Connection:** A wired connection ensures lag-free gameplay, crucial for competitive titles.* **Comfortable Design:** The controller's ergonomic design provides a comfortable grip for extended gaming sessions.* **Dual Vibration Motors:** The X15 features vibration feedback, enhancing the immersion of the gaming experience.* **Customizable Buttons:** The controller allows for remapping of buttons, catering to individual preferences.**Cons:*** **Basic Build Quality:** The X15 feels somewhat cheap in terms of materials and construction, lacking the premium quality found in higher-end controllers.* **Limited Features:** Compared to more expensive controllers, the X15 lacks features like adjustable triggers or a dedicated headphone jack.* **Subpar Analog Sticks:** The analog sticks might feel a bit loose and imprecise, potentially hindering precision in games demanding fine control.**Who should buy it?**The EasySMX X15 PC Controller is best suited for casual gamers who prioritize affordability and are not seeking a professional-grade controller. It's a decent option for basic gaming, but might not be ideal for competitive play or games requiring precise controls.**Who should avoid it?**Serious gamers looking for a high-performance controller with advanced features should consider spending more on a premium option. Those who prioritize build quality and precise control might find the X15 lacking.**Alternatives:**For a slightly higher price, you can find controllers like the Logitech F310 or the Xbox Wireless Controller for PC, which offer better build quality and functionality.**Conclusion:**The EasySMX X15 PC Controller is a decent entry-level option for casual gamers on a tight budget. However, it comes with certain compromises in build quality and features. If you need a budget-friendly controller for casual gaming, the X15 might be a suitable choice. But if you're looking for a high-performance controller, consider investing in a more expensive option.",

This will allow you to see where you want to place the light strips for the best effect. This is important because it will make the difference. The instructions for my 46 inch says to wrap but I actually placed mines on the sides of my tv. They aren't as discreet but you can only see them when you walk really close to the sides. This gave my tv the best lighting because my tv is mounted pretty high. I can't stress this enough because if I had placed the strips similar to the instructions then I would have thought these weren't bright. Everyone's tv to wall ratio is different.This may be common sense, but also install while in a dark room or dim lighting. Top of the morning is not going to give you the true effect of what it may look like and thus you may place the strips too far back on the tv or too far up depending on your wall to tv alignment.Once you've decided where, add the connectors one buy one leaving the end strand without a connector. I also kept the lights plugged in (idk if that's safe) to make sure that all of the lights were lighting appropriately. Glad I did because one of the connector strips didn't work and effected the light output. The first strip was pink, the other strips were blue. If you attach the adhesive first, then you will have to pull off, risking the strength of the stickiness, to put back on correctly. It's doable but not worth the hassle.The brightness adjustment on the remote matters. So I bought this because I wanted the pink light-- and solely the pink light. When I had the brightness all the way up, I could not see the different colors. I thought it was defective because even the pink color looked blue (which makes sense given color spectrum etc). So, make sure when you turn on the remote that you dim the brightness as much as possible so you can see all the colors.Now it's time to remove the adhesive! My adhesive was pretty darn good. The USB part also has an adhesive part. Make sure that you place the USB and adhesive to wear it is easy to pull out without messing with the adhesion (will make sense later).It is BRIGHT y'all. There is no \"dim\" feature. What I mean is although you can adjust the brightness, you cannot adjust the volume of light. By adjusting the brightness you are adjusting the color's brightness (ie from dark pink, to hot pink, to light pink) and not the light's strength/intensity. I thought i would be able to adjust the strength for nights that I don't necessarily want to feel the vibe but no. A minor flaw but I have a diffuser with a LED light so this doesn't necessarily bother me but may bother others. It's also $14 (at the time of this review) so I mean I couldn't ask for more.Here's what I DO NOT LIKE. There is technically no \"off\" position for the lights if your tv is on. If you turn \"off\" on the remote, the lights go red. It isn't until you turn the tv off (or power source) that the lights completely shut off. You can also take out the USB cord to cut the lights off while still keeping your tv on. This is why it's important to place the adhesive part of the USB cord where you can easily remove without having to mess up the adhesion. This is honestly minor but good to note when installing as to make sure the position of the USB is easily accessible and/or to appropriately place the lights for 24/7 viewing.All in all-- the product is great. The price point is great for what you get even with the \"off\" situation. The quality is also great. The color variations are great, as well. A couple reviewers stated that the white is not white but rather a blue and this is true. I would buy another just for keepsake-- that's how much I love them. It is definitely a vibe and elevates any room, any watching experience.",
        "Let me start this review by saying that I'm not really going to discuss the technical merits of these lights because...well, they work. They turn on and off with the TV (if we so choose), and they turn on and off with the remote. There are lots of fun \"effects,\" but we tend to leave it on the \"gently changing color mode\" (so it won't distract us from Moonshiners, or Gold Rush or Curse of Oak Island.) Our TV is 65\", so I needed an additional strand of lights, but we love the way it lights up only what we want (and ignores the pesky cables running down the middle.)Anyway, back to the review: Since \"everyone knows\" pictures speak volumes, I asked hubby to snap 1 or 2 that show the effect of the lights around the TV...and he sent me 30. I'm not kidding...he became a regular cinematographer in there, even going so far as to VIDEO the lights (so you can see them change!) That's just how much he loves these silly things. Call it Christmas for the other 11 months, but they are a super fun (and cheap) investment that will bring you hours of good clean fun. Really.Oh, and the customer service people are delightful and responsive. I had a question for them and they responded by email within a day. What that means is...there's actually someone on the other end of this product!In terms of brightness, the photos are unretouched, meaning the brightness is what you get when the lights are out and the TV is on. They aren't so bright that they compete with the television picture for your attention, but they add a very nice glow that kicks viewing up a notch.The remote requires a traditional 2032 round battery and is super easy to access/change (not that we've had to change it yet, but we inspected the remote so we'd know what we'd need to do when the time comes!)In terms of application...it's a no-brainer. You just peel and stick. Done. If you make a mistake, you can reposition (as long as you don't wait too long) and the adhesive won't ruin your television. Of course, these stick to the back, so does it really matter?The picture in the product description doesn't do these justice...I'll just say that. You really can't go wrong on them, so just buy a set (or two) and light up your world.",
        "These lights were super easy to install, took about 5 mins. The remote comes with a battery installed, lights come with adhesive (you can add more if you’d like), the color options are amazing and it’s so easy to use! Very fun little addition for an inexpensive price :)"

        "I used a Corsair RGB wireless XT gaming headset with the \"broadcaster quality mic\" for more than a year. I finally pitched them due to the problems I had with the quality of the sound, and even replaced the mic due to the mute button (on the mic piece) wearing out after a number of uses. It was just a high maintenance device with very short range issues as well as the iCUE app constantly crashing and losing my settings. The Corsair also had music listening issues where a deep drum or bass note would cause the master volume to compensate and was quite unnatural. I assume the volume would pulsate due to some kind of overload protection algorithm that I was unable to simply disable. It was quite annoying.Knew about the JBL reputation with stereo systems, and high quality HiFi systems in the passed, and decided to give them a try. They were also cheaper than the Corsair XT I had. Installed the driver program, turned on the \"DTS\" mode with the JBL Quantum surround mode and the sound BLEW ME AWAY! I NEVER had this kind of sound quality with the Corsair when listening to music. The bass is plentiful, and the equalizer works great all around. That's a positive.A negative I have is related to things like the \"surround sound\" mode. I don't get a true sound that makes me think there are things behind me, or directional like you get in a movie theater. Could be I really don't have a proper source to prove it out, but the windows positioning test isn't surrounding me like expected.When I'm gaming, I sometimes have a wide variety of sound sources that I mix into my headset. I have three separate PC's that sound outputs/inputs are \"daisy chained\" to allow me to monitor all the pc's outputs within my single headset. It allows me to do things like watch TV, game, monitor chat apps, listen to the radio, and a few other esoteric functions related to other hobbies all at the same time. So, I'm generally dealing with up to 5 separate PC monitors, and all the audio feeds from what ever I may have going on. The JBL seems to deal with them just fine without losing music quality, the gaming output, and others, simultaneously. Definitely a positive.I use the 2GHz dongle on a USB port, and even though we have a house full of wifi and wireless devices, the range is CONSIDERABLY farther than the corsair RGB XT. The corsair also would \"cut out\" when someone would use the microwave in the kitchen (which is attached to the room I'm in). Interestingly, the JBL headset does NOT cut out with microwave use, which again, is another positive here.I've seen folks complain that they don't get enough volume out of this headset, but that is not my experience. I'm retired with \"older ears\", and the volume is more than I would ever safely use. So, definitely a positive. The \"noise canceling\" is pretty good. Its not \"get on an airplane and not hear white noise\" good, but for gaming and listening to music, its quite good. The headset does claim to have ANC (Active Noise Canceling).Anyway, for the price, its better, IMO, than the high end corsair headset, yet less expensive. In my opinion JBL has a very high quality product that is very forgiving of an RF crowded environment, and a longer battery life. Just turn off the pretty flashy RGB lighting on the headset, and you'll get a ton of battery time. Specs claim you get 43 hours of battery time between charges. That's considerably better than the high end corsair.",
        "Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. JBL is a brand that I generally trust when it comes to audio.The noise canceling function is okay. It isn't the best that I've used, nor is it the worst. Gave that aspect 3 stars because it is middle-of-the-road.The sound quality is good and the ear pieces are comfortable, though they don't breathe very well. I primarily use these for meetings on Microsoft Teams. I find myself moving them off one ear if I'm 3 hours into back-to-back meetings. I believe the auto-shutoff is around 4 hours, as I've had them turn off mid-meeting before.I really like the dual mute option. There is a button, or you can flip up the microphone. The microphone could use a little more resistance in movement. I sneezed once and the mic fell back down to the \"on\" position. No one heard the sneeze, so not a big deal. I was just surprised that it didn't stay up. All-in-all, the mic stays where you put it (unless you have a violent sneeze).My biggest complaint might be more with Teams than the headset, but I'm not sure. The headset has to be powered on BEFORE I join a meeting. If they aren't on and connected prior to joining, no one can hear me. I have to switch to the computer mic and then back to the headset. A minor inconvenience. My last headset could be switched on while connecting to the meeting and it worked every time.The noise canceling mic works amazingly. By comparison, my last headset seemed to pic up ambient noise and amplify it. They were great if the room was quiet, but anyone else talking sounded like they were in the conversation. These do what they say! Ambient noise does not seem to be picked up. I've had kids playing and or talking loudly in the same room and people on calls do not hear them. To reiterate, that's kind of amazing!Battery life is adequate. I get about 2 days use on a charge. That's pretty good considering. On that note, I read that the cheaper JBL headset could not be used while charging. That's just dumb. These advertised that you can charge and use at the same time.A surprise feature that I LOVE is the dual audio source. I connected them to my phone via Bluetooth to test them out before connecting to my work computer via the wireless USB dongle. While on a meeting (and still connected to my phone) I heard my text notification from my phone while still on the call at work! You can even listen to music while people are going on about boring work stuff and never miss a beat (get it?)!I have not installed the software that is loaded on the USB dongle, so I don't know what customizations can be made. Another thing that I'm still figuring out is the various audio level adjusters. I believe one is for mic and the other for incoming audio. Sometimes someone on a call will sound faint and I just roll one or the other until I get them to the proper volume. It's a nice feature, but I haven't fully figured out which adjuster controls which audio level. It's really good if you have someone who talks too loud... you can turn them down on the fly.In summary, they are great headsets! There are a few quirks, but those are easy to work around. The pros far outweigh any cons.",
        "I have had this headset for 2 years now and have no issues with them. When I first got them, there were intermittent connection issues with the dongle, then JBL released firmware updates and ever since then, I had no issues. The audio is nice and clear, the same when I use the 3.5mm jack with a good headphone amp. I can walk 1/2 my house without issue. Bluetooth has been rock solid. I love that I can play and talk at the same time, something I can't do my other over priced headsets. The noise cancelling is good for what it is, it keeps me focused and immersed in the game without loss of audio quality. Spatial cues are accurate and clear. The LED's are neat, but I mostly leave them off, you can't see them when wearing the headset anyways. Battery life is awesome. I can game for 8hrs and have more than 60% battery remaining, even after 2yrs. of use.Durability has not been a problem as I take really good care of all my headsets, but the quality is there. I also have a hard case that I store them in when not in use or travelling.The microphone is clear and natural enough for me,  and has worked without issues.The only thing I would say that could be improved on is the volume. Even at max, I find myself doubting that I have everything setup properly.Overall, I say that with this headset, it is money well spent. I tried to replicate many of the issues that many others have stated: using them on other computers, such as friends and family's, in there homes just to ensure the dynamics, and they continue to work flawless. So much so that my peeps eventually purchased the headset. I also purchased the 910x model with the same satisfaction.Keep in mind, there is no perfect headset, just find what works for you, and this headset works really well for me."

        "***Update: I had originally given these 3 stars per below, but after more time I've updated it to 5... The battery life and wireless range is phenomenal, both are so much better than my previous Corsairs! I was charging those daily, after only about 4-5 hours I'd get low battery warnings, but I almost never have to charge these, it's insane how long they last... and the range is almost twice what I got from the Corsairs, I can roam all over and never lose sound! So just be sure to tweak the sound a bit as I noted before, and maybe about $15 of the price is simply for the brand name, but I'm liking these more and more with time!Initial Review:Ok, I'm really torn on these... First things first: myself, along with many others, think the sound quality is horrible out of the box! People that say they sound great I don't think have experience with more expensive headphones and are probably moving up from $30 cheapos...First thing: After scouring Reddit and some trial and error, turn off all the special sound settings (like DTS and advanced settings) and move the bass to +7 and the treble to +4. After I made this change, the quality was much much better!I previously had Corsair HS70s for two years and HS80s for two years, but I hate the iCue software Corsair uses, it's a ridiculous resource hog and constantly has issues. So for me this is actually a mild downgrade price-wise as you read my pros and cons, they're primarily vs my Corsairs:Pros: Incredibly lightweight and very comfortable. Battery lasts absolutely forever (I had to charge my Corsairs daily; the Logitech can go for days!). Sound is adequate once tweaked. Volume tops off at a low level but as a 45-year-old who is a huge music fan I can tell my ears aren't what they once were, so they're doing this for your protection. Software is \"light-weight\" and unobtrusive.Cons: If you're mainly listening to music, spend a bit more on Corsair or Steelseries or even a purely audiophile set. You'll be disappointed with these. They're lightweight but as a downer feel a bit flimsy. As I said, sound is terrible out of the box imo.I really struggled with the number of stars to give! For the money, if you know you're getting a lightweight pair of headphones with great battery and no hassle, they're not bad at all. If you want more quality to your sound, go elsewhere however. A little bit more money can get you a way better sound.As for Logitech in general, I was tired of having three different programs (keyboard, mouse, headphones) so also got a Logitech mouse after remembering one I loved years back. The brand does feel overpriced for the quality they provide, as a general rule, as if they're capitalizing off their brand. I'm ok with both these and the mouse, they're fine, but for just $20-40 more each I'd say try one of the newer brands if you haven't before. The Logitech stuff just feels cheaper overall than the price would suggest but they get the job done!",
        "I bought a G733 a couple of years ago and just recently got my wife this white one. It has been my favorite headset I've used because its very light and the sound quality is great. I can use this headset while several feet away from my computer without issue. The removable mic is very convenient since it converts the headset into just heaphones because my wife and I like to wear this headset while doing household chores. The adjustable headband sits very easy on our heads and makes this headset very comfortable for several hour usage.The battery life is great and the wireless reach is fantastic. This headset is very much worth the price and we will keep this headset for a very long time.",
        "I bought these as a replacement for my old RIG headphones when they gave out after 8 years. I wasn't impressed with the reviews of the new Rigs so I thought I would give these a try. I use them for several hours every day (4-8). The range is amazing. Better than my Openrun aftershokz I use for my iPhone. My house is around 2200 square ft and if my phone is in the office, the Openruns will cut out when I walk to the back bedroom. These stay connected and clear everywhere in the house. I use them for work as well as gaming. I don't do FPS gaming so I cannot comment on the clarity there, but I run D&D games through a VTT/Discord and the sound quality is exceptional. The software is easy to use and calibrate. I love the option to change the colors and style of the lights. It uses a dongle rather than Bluetooth connection and it is USB. The lights are easily turned off if you need to and the buttons are conveniently placed. The best thing though is the comfort. They are probably the lightest headphones I have ever had. The cushioned earpieces are soft and snug. I have a small head and I love the headband that allows me to fit them properly. The battery life is exceptional. I have had them now for just under a month and I have charged them only TWICE. The charging cord is a decent length and good quality. I would recommend these for anyone who spends long hours working or gaming for the comfort alone. The only downside I have found is probably the microphone. It has great pick up and quality, but I would have preferred one that flips up rather than a detachable one, but it is flexible to an extent so not too much of an issue. I frequently remove it and use an external mic if I am not going to be getting up while working but put it back in if I am moving around. Overall, it has been a solid purchase."

        "I’m new to the custom keyboard hobby and love the coiled cable look against the keyboard, while also keeping cables tangle free at an affordable price.It’s just the right length and the cable feels highly durable. Although I get the intention of the 5-pin quick disconnect aviator, I’ll probably find myself just unplugging the USB-C directly. Albeit, it still looks super cool.Well packaged and neatly boxed. Highly satisfied!",
        "As a dedicated gamer and tech enthusiast, I’ve gone through my fair share of cables for my gaming keyboard, but this Custom Coiled USB C Cable stands out as one of the best I’ve used. Here's why:1. Premium Build Quality: The cable feels incredibly sturdy and well-constructed, with a durable yet flexible exterior. The coil is tight but not overly stiff, offering excellent strain relief. The USB C connectors themselves are high-quality, ensuring a solid, reliable connection without any wobbling or loose fits. This is crucial for a smooth gaming experience.2. Aesthetic Appeal: The coiled design gives a unique and stylish touch to any gaming setup. I opted for the custom color option, and it looks great with my RGB gaming keyboard. It’s a great way to add personality and flair to your desk while maintaining a professional, clean look.3. Functional Length: At 5 feet when fully extended, this cable offers a great balance between freedom of movement and keeping things neat. The coil ensures it doesn’t get in the way, but it still provides enough length for an organized and tidy workspace. Plus, it's resistant to tangling, which is a big bonus.Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with this Custom Coiled USB C Cable for my gaming keyboard. If you're in the market for a high-quality, reliable, and stylish cable, I highly recommend this product. It's a small investment that makes a noticeable difference in both performance and appearance.",
        "🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 The Cable That Saved My Sanity (and My Son’s Setup!)Let me start with a confession: My son is the ultimate “ask Dad, then ask Mom” expert. He’ll come to me first with questions about all things gaming, but when he doesn’t get the answer he wants, he immediately heads over to Mom – the Queen of Amazon Prime, aka “The Clicker of All Things Awesome.” We joke that people think we’re Amazon delivery drivers because of how often those brown boxes show up at our door. At one point, our neighbors actually thought we had an Amazon Prime delivery van!So, when my son decided his gaming keyboard wasn’t “pro” enough without a fancy custom coiled cable, guess who he came to first? Yup, me. After explaining to me the importance of a USB-C cable with a detachable aviator connector (because apparently that’s critical to victory in Fortnite), he wasn’t thrilled with my casual “just use the one you’ve got” response.Of course, Mom swoops in with her magical Prime powers, and within two days (thank you, Prime addiction), the GUNMJO Pro Custom Coiled USB-C Cable in sleek carbon black shows up at our doorstep.The Verdict:Top-Tier Build Quality: This thing is a beast. Double-sleeved for durability and the coiled design just screams pro-gamer. My son’s gaming setup now looks straight out of a sci-fi movie, and I have to admit, it’s a huge upgrade from his previous tangled mess of a cable.Detachable Metal Aviator Connector: I thought the “aviator connector” was just some flashy gimmick, but nope! It’s actually super convenient and adds a rugged, industrial vibe to the setup. My son swaps out keyboards all the time, and now he can do it effortlessly, like some kind of tech wizard.Perfect Length: At 1.5 meters, this cable is long enough to reach his gaming tower without cluttering the desk, but short enough to avoid the dreaded cable spaghetti under his desk. It’s like the Goldilocks of USB cables—just right.Performance Boost?: Okay, maybe it’s just the placebo effect, but my son swears his keystrokes feel more responsive with this cable. I’m not sure if that’s true, but hey, if he’s happy, I’m happy.Sleek Carbon Black Design: This cable is a head-turner. The matte black finish fits perfectly with his all-black gaming setup, giving it that professional, clean look he’s always wanted. Now, his friends are asking where they can get one!The Bottom Line: My son’s over the moon with his GUNMJO cable, and I’m just happy I don’t have to hear about the “laggy old cable” anymore. Kudos to Amazon Prime and my wife for always saving the day (and my sanity). If you’re looking to upgrade your setup with a top-notch USB-C cable, trust me, this one’s a game-changer. Just ask my son—or better yet, ask my wife! 😂"

        "TLDR: The Fifine AM8 is a fantastic budget competitor to much higher-end mics like the Shure SM7B, while still maintaining aesthetics and quality, but that does come with a few quirks, as expected of the less expensive option.I found out about Fifine through a review of the A8 while looking for a more value-oriented, but still highly performant mic, and although I was impressed with the A8's sound quality, it is a compressor mic, and I quickly realized there is a reason professionals tend to stick closely to dynamic's. Thus, after finding that the same brand had released this mic, a similarly priced, value-oriented dynamic mic that supports XLR, comes with an arm, and can even trade blows with the infamous Shure SM7B ( as seen in video titles like \"DO NOT Waste Your Money on The Shure SM7B\" on Youtube), I didn't take long at all to place an order.Upon opening the box, I was not disappointed with the aesthetics, as, despite its plastic construction and RGB, it maintains a professional look, and feels solid and hefty in the hand and the stand likewise does not appear flimsy despite its low price. While setting it up, the stand does show its price a bit with its thin, hollow construction, but alas, this is to be expected for the price, and although it is a little short, after set up I have rarely had to think about the stand at all, a sign that it is indeed doing its job perfectly well. The mic, on the other hand, only raises expectations further during setup, with the well-diffused back RGB showing off immediately upon being plugged in, and the capacitive buttons feeling very consistent and responsive. I was also very glad to see that the PC sound passthrough from the headset monitoring port required no setup, started automatically, and sounded indistinguishable from the built-in pc sound. I did however notice a few quirks with this set, such as tapping or hitting the desk sometimes reverberating through the stand and being audible through the mic, the on-mic features (buttons, dials, and RGB,) not functioning without USB C power (such as when using XLR), and the mic reverting to whichever connection method (USB or XLR) was connected first, with no button to switch between the two, and instead having to unplug and plug the mic back in to switch.The sound test was about as I expected from hearing the mic on Youtube, which is fantastic, as the mic does indeed prove itself to be impressively close to mics like the  Shure SM7B. With this level of sound quality, if you are, like me, looking for an endgame mic to use for anything from gaming, zoom calls, or even \"prosumer\" level work like content creation, I see no reason to look for any more than this mic, as the diminishing returns of higher-end mics are simply not worth it for personal use, and 99% of people would not be able to tell the difference between this mic and an actual professional mic (see previously mentioned youtube video). That being said, if audio is your main hobby, or if you would be using this mic professionally, then, and only then you have reason to look further.",
        "I have nothing but good things to say about this microphone. If you don't want to read a long review, the tl;dr: This is a great plug-n-play microphone that has great sound quality and a price that can't be beat.When the pandemic hit in 2020, I started playing online games with friends. When things went back to normal a few years later, we kept playing online as many of us had moved to different areas of the US.During that time, I used a nice set of bluetooth headphones and that was adequate. We mostly played strategy games, board games, or poker games where sound quality didn't matter.In 2024 we hopped on the Helldivers 2 train and the bluetooth headphones just weren't cutting it. To use the microphone with bluetooth, you have to accept the sound changes from full stereo to hands-free mono. For a game like Helldivers 2, that just didn't work. I couldn't hear anything at all.So I decided to invest in a microphone. I know nothing at all about microphones and just wanted something relatively cheap that would work. I did a little research and the main thing people said was to get a \"dynamic mic\" as opposed to a \"condenser mic\". Shocker, the dynamic mics are more expensive, often costing $100+.I ended up getting this Fifine, which was significantly cheaper. And to be honest, I wouldn't be able to tell it was a cheap model. The quality of this mic looks really good and feels solid. It uses USB-C which is nice, and even has an XLR jack for the serious audio people (I don't know anything about this -- I just use the USB jack).It is seriously plug-n-play. It took me all of 5 minutes to unbox and get set up at my desk. It just...works.The only additional recommendation I'd make. Even though this is supposed a \"dynamic mic\" which only picks up sounds right next to the mic, I found this still picked up all my keyboard strokes and could even pick up mouse clicking.The solution to this if you have an Nvidia card is Nvidia Broadcast. It is free and it has some sort of noise filtering that does an excellent job to remove background noise like what I mentioned above.If you need a stand and a mic and don't want to dive down the rabbit-hole of audio equipment, this is probably your best value-to-quality option. It's no nonsense, dead easy to set up, and in conjunction with noise filtering software like Nvidia Broadcast sounds phenomenal.",
        "The microphone is insane for its price and I recommend buying it. First, the microphone sounds insane, the sound is well-balanced and sounds great for the price. The boom arm is not too shabby either, it is well-made and very high quality. The design of the mic itself is very beautiful and eye-catching.  The RGB is milky and pops with color. The foam covering the mic blocks most of the spitting and annoying sounds in the background. The only thing I would improve is the cable, it is stiff. Besides that, the microphone has a lot of buttons allowing you to easily change the sound, RGB, and the eq of the mic.Overall if you want a budget high quality podcast microphone I recommend giving this one a shot!"

        "Hello, this item is WAY too complicated for what it is. The usb-c port on it is very bad to the point where any motion on the cable will cause it to disconnect, which also resets your settings. I have tried over 20 different cables, and adapters, and nothing helped. It is an internal issue it seems. And when it does finally work, it randomly will just start spazzing out flicking the screen all over the place. The spazzing thing is not even user error as it has happened when I wasn’t even touching the controller. I’ve also tried multiple different controllers as well. This is very disappointing coming from such a great company as Collective Minds. Apart from its many many issues, it is ok, mediocre at best in my experience with it."

You can easily set a mood for a romantic evening, a pamper yourself night or just to brighten up a room.  It is great for a party. You can sync it to music and have your own disco.  I have received so many compliments.  It's very slim and doesn't take up a lot of space.  It captures the attention of our guests immediately.  I love that I can control the functions from the remote and/or the app.  I don't even have to remember to turn it off as you can set a timer on it.  It is loaded with so many features!!!  It is reasonably priced for all of its functions, and I definitely recommend purchasing this.  I'm thinking about purchasing a second one for our guest bedroom.  I can't believe I got so many features in this lamp for a reasonable price.  That's a plus for me!  The only thing I haven't tried is to see if I can connect it to Alexa."

        "I absolutely love the scroll wheel on the G502x and I wish more companies would adopt something similar, but I ultimately went with the Spatha because it's simply so much more comfortable. This is one of the few mice that has a ring finger rest which I find absolutely essential. It's comfortable and has all the thumb buttons I need.The only complaint I have is that it is a bit heavy which is unfavorable for fps games which I prefer, and the scroll wheel encoder is a standard type that feels spongy will inevitably wear out. At least they made it easy to take the mouse apart and fix when the time comes.It's definitely the most expensive mouse I've ever bought so I hope it lasts. Seems to be built like a brick which is good.",
        "I've been using my Logitech G600 for years. It's my standard that I compare all other mice to.The armory crate software can be a little frustrating, I'm not going to lie. I had to install it, uninstall it, install it again and bypass an error to get it working. The customization on the lighting is a little lackluster, but it's not why I'm here.I like it a lot. There are fewer buttons than other MMO mice have, but honestly, I don't use all the buttons on my G600, so that's fine. I like a nice, big mouse. I like a mouse I can wrap my hand around, and this mouse fits my hand perfectly, pinkie and ring fingers included.The side buttons are nice and big, as well. The fact that there are fewer of them makes it easier for me to press them individually, because they're so much bigger to compensate.With a little more customization in the AC software, this could absolutely become my go to mouse.",

        "I'm new to thocky keyboards, but I believe this one is great for the price. Sound is excellent, RGB looks good despite not having shine-through keycaps (not using it that much though) and build quality feels solid. Battery life is extremely good for my needs. I haven't exactly measured it, but with occasional gaming sessions, web browsing, some typing and RGB off it has been going without charging for almost 2 weeks now. Talking about gaming, I'm a competitive player, but not to the point of actually being benefited by rapid trigger or stuff like that, so it works well for me, but might not be good enough for more advanced players. For typing tho, it is the best keyboard I've ever had.Some cons are that it apparently isn't easy to customize since it's held by plastic clips instead of screws, and it also has north facing LEDs. The latter is not really a deal breaker because the switches (LEOBOG Reapers) are fairly tall and don't interfere with cherry profile keycaps, but if you want to use other switch-keycap combos it might be a problem. Software is bad, but I've only used it once to see what was up and uninstalled it immediately after, so not really an issue.It's great for what it is: a pre-built customizable-ish good quality tri-mode 75% keyboard",

It is soft and cozy and not too thick which is perfect because they both sleep hot, the size is great for toddlers, easy to wash and dryer friendly, it is great quality for the price and warm enough to not have them sweat!! Absolutely loved this blanket for my littles!!",

        "The color on this blanket is vibrant, super soft, it's thin, lightweight, the quality so far has held up. I haven't had to wash it yet so I'm unsure of its Washability, it doesn't seem to shed, and the glow quality is fantastic! I would buy another blanket from this company.Only con, that to me isn't a con but more of a something you might wanna know, is the places that glow in the dark, the fibers are more stiff feeling, but I'm assuming it's what they use on the fabric to make it glow and it's not too noticeable and doesn't bother me at all. I'm more impressed with the fact that it glows so well. Definitely would recommend this blanket.",

        "The controller is great, the buttons are supper tactile and arent squishy. I personally use a long joystick on my right and a short on the left, when using an xbox controller the ABXY buttons have a bit of travel so i notice the longer joystick but with the Manba i almost forgot about the longer joystick because of the buttons shorter travel that being said the xbox might feel a bit better in the hand because its slightly wider where the Monba is a but more squished but thats all dependent on hand size and how u hold it as for the back buttons they are a bit hard to hit if ur using both middle and ring fingers but a little easier if u just use the middle if u can reach. Esthetically the clear looks great seeing the rumble motors with a bit of the led bleeding into the background looks fantastic; in terms of features id say the screen is more for people that are very picky about controlls and how the controller responds for example i personally play with a high dpi set on my mouse cause i want thr sensitivity to be the dame across all games so when it comes to this controller it fits in for me because initially the joystick deadzone was a bit wide for me so i lowered it in the controller settings so itd be the same across all my games and on whatever device i decide to connect to. Which speaking of connection its incredibly fast soon as this thing either gets turned on or woken up its ready to play same for swapping between pc and android. Lastly the fact this thing comes with its own charging stand is a mega plus for me i dont like plugging things in specificly my phone and controllers id prefer to grab and go so the fact it comes with its own deserves a pat on the back it even chimes when the controller is placed on it so u know when youve got a connection.So despite what others may say if ur lookin for a controller and have the cash id say give this one a shot it looks great, has plenty of features for you to customize, and connects fast with some clicky buttons if u prefer those over the usual squish",
        "This was purchased as a place holder for a replacement Xbox elite series 2 controller, because my old one was coming apart and has awful stick drift. I also purchased a Razer Wolverine ultimate (wired controller), that had odd connection issues. This controller is cheaper and better than the Razer and the elite 2 because the feature set is fantastic for the price. I'm so glad I found a \"Pro controller\" with hall effect thumbsticks, and mechanical button switches as well as this cool screen at this price point. It was easy to connect to my PC with the provided dongle, mapping the rear buttons was very simple, and it just works so well with all my games.I've played Atlas Fallen, Star Trucker, Mortal Kombat 1, the COD black ops 6 beta, and COD MWZ with this so far, and it is fast and comfortable. It looks great, the screen and internal software make it easy to configure and use button macros. The rear buttons are placed in just the right spot and angle for speed and comfort. The exchangeable thumbsticks, faceplate, and the other provided accessories like the charging dock and dongle are all you need for a \"pro controller\" on PC experience.  I plan to try and overclock it later but really I haven't done that yet because it really doesn't need it because it seems so responsive right out of the box. I highly recommend this affordable hidden gem of a controller as a Long time \"Pro gamer\".",
        "I have personally been in the market for a conroller for some time now. Over the last few years ive been trying multiple different controllers ranging from $20+. This controller had exactly what I was looking for and then some! Im shocked for the price this quality is amazing. Easily a controller worth more than $100.First of all the look is quite incredible and photos wont do it justice. In person its beautiful and Ive actually received random compliments from others coming into my room and seeing it there on its stand.Second the stand does its job and the controller slide and holds easily on and off while also showing a battery charging symbol on its screen so you can visually see it.Third the screen. Alot of people dont realize the value this screen provides. Easily providing all the options you need without having to use any kinda of software or code. Ive been through controllers where i have to hold certain buttons to key the macro back buttons and its just a bit of a headache and I usually forget. This screen makes it so I can adjust anything I need to such as joystick responsiveness / button mapping AND even multiple RGB colors for icing on the cake. It even has 4 profiles so you can having different customizations for different games without needing to change everytimeFourth speaking of sticks and macros the 2 buttons on the back are a plus along with the triggers being able to have short triggers but the most beautiful part that caught me off guard was the long sticks they send with the controller NO EXTRA COST. These joysticks you can just pull off or pop right on in less than 5 seconds. The longer sticks allow you to have more precise movement making all your deadzones better. Personally im running a long left stick and a short right stick. This with the trigger stopper option and RGB you just feel like your holding your own custom controller catered to your personal playstyleFifth its BOTH wired/bluetooth. THE bluetooth without even needing to turn on your pc bluetooth. You can simply plug and play with the receiver provided. Ive had such a smooth experience not having to tab out and turn my bluetooth on litterally just plug in the little piece and im ready to go. Also even if you ran the battery dead which btw lasts really long then you could just use the optional wire thats also provided too.Finally theres an on/off button right on the back so you can just push that anytime to really push your battery life to its limits inbetween games. I bought it 2 days ago and ive probably already put 10+ hours on it and still havent charged it. It came charged too! It even will shut itself off if you go idle for a long time to save itself.Honestly i cant believe this package / deal. Even received a message from them after purchasing it. I wish I had come across this sooner! Literally one of the best piece of gaming equipment ive ever owned. I find myself excited to play any game just getting that excitement to take it off its stand and watch it bootup.They say a perfect rating doesnt exist but my gosh im giving this a 9.99/10. If you took the time to read my review id say dont even hesitate or let anyone fool you. This controller is godlike!!"

        "Bought this item for my gamer boyfriend. He loves it. Super cool that it can change light colors so it can match whatever aesthetic you’re going for. Very nice to have the charging ports as well so it’s useful and aesthetically pleasing, and quite inexpensive! It’s smaller than I expected, but that’s actually good because my boyfriend has a very cluttered desk so it’s nice that the stand doesn’t take up much room. I recommend it to anyone looking for a nice little accessory to add to a gaming setup, or if you’re looking for a gift for the gamer in your life!",
        "Easy to assemble, sturdy build, easy to use, amazing price and matches the aesthetic of my Hello Kitty razer headset. Honestly, you can’t beat the price and quality on this one. I ordered it disregarding the one star reviews and I’m glad I did so. With pressing the one button at the base, you can decide if you want it to flow through the different colors or have it set on just one color. I ordered the pink color and when my item arrived, I was a bit nervous as I saw it had the black headset stand picture on the front (I say so as I had read reviews of people saying they received the wrong color stand), but the sticker on the back of the box said it was the pink one, so I opened the box and I was happy to see it was the pink stand. I found the instructions, I saw how I’m supposed to put it together and in less than a minute my stand was ready. Hope this helps people decide to save themselves some money and get an awesome product. Kudos to New Bee for this.",
        "This headphone stand is functional as well as mesmerizing to look at. It was so easy to assemble and holds the headphones perfectly. The built in lighting is really pretty, and you can change it to whatever you want or leave it on the multi-color setting. It charges the headphones as well. Perfect solution for keeping headphones off of tables and out of the way."

        "Seems to be good bang for your buck; just got them in tonight and. have been using for the past hour. Honestly I'm surprised at how comfortable they are and at the sound as well. They are not fully noise-cancelling (to be expected) but the quality of the sound is great. I haven't used the mic feature yet and am having some trouble getting the input to work for it, so I may put this down to 4 stars if that persists. I got these since I work from home and it won't be a huge deal if that feature ends up not being compatible with my desktop Mac, but definitely a little irritating atm. Overall I like what I paid for. EDIT: It took a lot of tinkering with plugging in and out and twisting in the ports to get my input mic to work. But it works and the quality of my recordings and calls are great! It is a little quiet, so I had to turn my dials all the way up but sounds great now.",
        "(Slight tldr pros and cons below) I’ve had the first gen since 2018 and when I saw the second gen I just had to get them and put old reliable in retirement. As of first getting the gen 2 and writing this review I have loved the 2 gen. Both comfortable and light as well as decent color selection but it’s easier if I do pros and consPros1. Super durable I have twisted them and put them to the test just like my first and still retained it’s shape and no signs of cracks anywhere2. Comfortability I have worn these headsets for hours on in and I can say for sure it feels like I’m not even wearing them but still feel really secure to my head3. Easy to clean (can’t say how easy since I have no need to clean them yet other than hair4. Price I mean you can’t beat a good durable headset for 40-60$5. Compatibility works great on my PC, Xbox and my switch but I hardly use headphones for the switch anywaysAnd now onto some cons1. The headphone jack (atleast for gen 1) is like playing Russian roulette could work up to a year or break next month most notably the audio slider could have it all the way up and only one ear has audio slightly bring it down and both work (recommend getting spare cords Amazon does sell them)2. Lack of options (more a personal attack) wish there were options for no mics or wireless since I use a different mic for talkingAnd lastly mixed opinion is the audio some say it’s best for single player. I play a lot of games that sound is key such as escape from Tarkov, day z and so on. I personally have not faced such an issue where this headset would struggle I could still pinpoint where gunfire and explosion happen no matter how chaotic with both gen 1 and 2As of now this is all I can think of I’ll update as I go on but for now I recommend this headset with a just the acceptation of being prepared to buy spare audio cables for the headset.Edit 5/1/24Wow almost two years and the headset is still going strong i have put ALOT of abuse on the headset so what are my thoughts on it now ?Well the audio slider has given out id say about 9 months in upon purchase but its minor being a small adjustment its working as intended, now onto the cleaning still just as easy just pull the ear muffs off and hand wash let it air dry and continue on. durability still on par as Gen 1 thanks to a nephew they can be thrown off the porch hitting objects such as cars and a tree and still work after plugging back in. Though have notice after some time it will hold what ever bend you put on it BUT it still will not crack or break so yea it was and still is worth every penny.",
        "This headset isn't terrible by any means, the sound quality and noise cancellation is excellent. the only downside is the microphone sound quality is very scratchy and does not sound very good to me. Yes for the price point it is decent, I believe there are much better microphones for the same price point if you are only looking to use it as a communication device."

        "I bought the JoyReken 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub, FlyingVHUB for my grandfather, who had a hard time reaching the ports on his new desktop computer. I wanted something that would make accessing his USB devices easier without overwhelming him with complicated tech, and this hub has been a perfect solution!The vertical design is a a simple approach, it stands upright, so it doesn't take up much space on his desk and keeps everything organized. The 2-foot extended cable is just the right length, allowing him to place the hub in a more accessible spot, which is really important since he struggled with reaching the back of his PC.Even though he’s not very tech-savvy, the simplicity of this hub made it really easy for him to use right away. He plugs in his flash drives, external hard drive, and other devices with no issues. It's truly plug-and-play, no need for any setup or complicated instructions.Another bonus is how well it works across different devices – we’ve tested it on his laptop and even on a gaming console, and it performs flawlessly with everything. The build quality is solid, and despite being lightweight, it doesn’t tip over or feel flimsy. Plus, the speed of the USB 3.0 is impressive, with fast data transfers for his external hard drives.If you're looking for a reliable, space-saving, and easy-to-use USB hub that works across multiple devices. I highly recommend this one. It’s been a wonderful  my grandfather.",
        "As a tech enthusiast with an eye for style, I recently added the Pink USB Hub to my setup, and I must say, it’s more than just a pretty accessory – it’s a functional powerhouse that lives up to its promises.First and foremost, let’s talk about the design. The hub’s pastel pink hue and sleek, compact design add a delightful pop of color to my workspace. It’s not just a mundane piece of tech; it’s a statement piece that brings joy every time I glance at it.But aesthetics aside, what truly sets this USB hub apart is its functionality. With multiple USB ports, it effortlessly handles all my peripheral devices – from my mouse and keyboard to my external hard drive and smartphone charger – without missing a beat. The transfer speeds are impressive, ensuring that data moves swiftly between devices without any lag or interruption.One of the features I appreciate most is its compatibility with various devices and operating systems. Whether I’m using a Mac, PC, or even a tablet, the Pink USB Hub seamlessly integrates with all my devices, making it incredibly versatile and convenient.Furthermore, the hub’s sturdy construction gives me confidence in its durability. Despite its petite size, it feels robust and well-built, capable of withstanding the rigors of daily use.The Pink USB Hub is not just a charming addition to my desk – it’s a reliable workhorse that simplifies my digital life. Its adorable design and impressive functionality make it a standout choice for anyone seeking both style and substance in their tech accessories. Highly recommended!",
        "…but it functions incredibly well. I can run three 3.2 drives flawlessly. No stutter or shared bandwidth issues. This item excels at providing access to the three drives with consistent read/write processes for a developer. I don’t like the light in the top port being brighter than the rest, and the dust-collecting design on the top corner is blech. I don’t mind the blue V, it’s small and just bright enough to be visible, which is a pro for me, but that top USB port, I put a drive in it to block the lighthouse beam of light and when it isn’t being utilized a rubber USB port protector. But aesthetics are not my focus for use and many said theirs did this as well; I’m in it for the functionality, and it excels for 3-port use all day long. Impressed."

I can use this headset all over the house with no quality issues!- They are insanely comfortable! Both myself and my 10 year old can wear these and they are comfortable over long periods of time for both of us!- Because they are wireless I no longer have to worry about my son pulling the cord or bending it and ruining the headsetI have no cons to this headset.

        "I’ve only had this lumbar back support pillow for two days, and honestly, it feels like I’ve been doing yoga, even though I haven’t! It’s incredible. Out of everything I’ve bought on Amazon—books, gadgets, you name it—this is by far my favorite purchase. I suffer from chronic back pain, and as an Uber driver who spends long hours behind the wheel, finding something that offers real comfort has been a game changer.I recently switched to a rental car that doesn’t have an electric seat adjuster, so I needed something to make my long drives more bearable. I’m amazed by how this pillow feels as though it’s fixing my back, almost like I’ve been to a masseuse or chiropractor. I honestly don’t know how I survived without it!If you drive for a living or sit for long periods like I do, I highly recommend this pillow. I can’t wait to get more for my computer chair and anywhere else I sit for extended periods. It’s that good! It’s versatile, and the relief is real.If you’re dealing with back pain, especially if you haven’t been stretching or doing exercises regularly like me, you owe it to yourself to try this. I hope this review encourages you to make the purchase—you deserve to feel as great as I do!",
        "My first two purchases of these were for a relative whose sun room chairs had little lumbar support.  They added so much comfort that an additional pillow was ordered.  My recent order was for family members who were staying with someone in the hospital.  If you've ever spent much time in one of the hospital chairs, you'd appreciate the comfort this pillow offers!",
        "I bought this to use at home while sitting in a comfortable chair or couch. It helps tremendously with my posture. I like that it’s not too thick so it doesn’t push you right out of your chair. I only gave it a 4 because I wish it had more thoracic support. Otherwise it’s the best I’ve tried"

        "I have small hands, 6.5 inches from palm to middle finger tip and ring sizes 4.5-6. I'm able to use this but I did need to shift my hand position to the right so I could use the thumb buttons. I swaped the directional keys to correspond and added some textured gaming keycap stickers to help me learn the new keybinds. I am able to use all of the buttons easily except the top row which requires a little stretch to reach but that's fine with me, I just make those the seldom used keybinds. I needed more pinky modifier buttons as well as thumb accessible modifier buttons (the D-pad is perfect for that). I use this for gaming along with a G600 mouse, it works wonderfully and solved the problem I was having with needing more modifiers and being able to hit binds faster/more reliably. You can record double modifiers with this such as Alt+Shift, I needed that feature specifically. It looks amazing matching my mercury huntsman mini and I love having a separate keypad for gaming rather than using my keyboard. It allows me to have crazy re-mapped keybinds without losing the ability to type normally. I use W A,S D,Q, and E; all the rest of the keys are re-mapped to numpad or modifiers. The space bar key (20) is a bit low and the distance makes it unreliable for me to use quickly so its in the seldom used keybind category. I re-mapped the circular button above the D-pad to map, the D-pad is space bar and 3 modifiers. The little D-pad thumbstick attachment is really great, too!<>- 6 month update-I absolutely love this thing.  I've adjusted to using it all the time for gaming and it is so incredibly comfortable. The wrist rest is my favorite part in regards to comfort and the hand positioning in general is relaxing, the shorter keycaps help with this. I found some better gripy texture tape for my most used keys. The joy stick for the D-pad has become pivitol for my gameplay. I love this thing so much that I got a second one for couch gaming. Synapse 3 doesn't support 2 of the same device running at once so I had to get a USB splitter. I purchased both devices \"Used like new\" and they have been wonderful. Both arrived in perfect condition with no blemishes or malfunction.- 6 mo th update on the second I purchased in \"Like New\" Condition.  One of the keys broke out of nowhere while I was using it. The device had not been damaged while in my care. Razer does not sell replacement keys for this item and refuses to provide them. Keys are not covered in the warranty, so if they break you are out of luck. However, I was able to find these keys on Amazon that replace the low profile Taryarus keys perfectly -lamd they are very affordable -X-keys Keycap Cherry MX Compatible",
        "I cannot put into words how unbelievably incredibly this product is. I legit want to be Razor's new spokesperson after what this thing has gone through and it still works perfectly. Let me explain for those who are wondering if this product is worth buying:I've owned this product for over 2 years now and it has changed my gaming experienced in ways that only divine intervention could achieve. A couple months ago, I was playing a game and was really in the mood for some egg nog, given the holiday spirit. I poured a red Solo cups full of nog (which is 16 oz of egg nog, by the way), walked it from my kitchen to my room, tripped over my dog as I entered my bedroom, and proceeded to spill every drop of the nog directly into the keys of my Razor gamepad. I thought my $2,500 computer would explode, but instead, nothing happened.I quickly unplugged my Razor, ran to the kitchen, turned the sink on full blast, and drenched this glorious contraption in water. I know you're not supposed to submerge electronic products, but it was either the water, or the thick, sugary, sticky, goopy egg nog, and I chose water. I rinsed it out for about 20 minutes and then shook the water out into a towel. I realized there was probably still some drops of water inside and didn't want to plug it back in and test it while it was still wet.So I set up a table in front of a space heater and decided to leave it there for 10 or 15 minutes. When I returned, HALF OF THE RAZER WAS MELTED ABD WARPED BY THE SPACE HEATER. Apparently the heater was on high and I set the Razer too close to it. At this point, I start going through all the stages of grief. I'm angry, crying, laughing, depressed, bartering with God Himself, and eventually just accept the fact that I will have to buy a new baby.I spend the next 24 hours wallowing in sorrow as I lost the only true love of my life. The next day I plug in my warped, twisted, previously egg nog filled Razer, and by the grace of God Almighty, it powers on. The buttons click perfectly, everything is responsive, nothing is wrong whatsoever. It has been two months since that incident and I have not encountered a single issue. And I game A LOT. This beautiful piece of hand crafted machinery is the greatest purchase I have ever made.Now, onto the other reasons you won't regret buying this incredible gamepad:1. Unbelievably comfortable.2. You'll never have to change in-game controlls, you simply change your own controls on the gamepad (which means you can leave your game control settings as default).3. Looks stunning in your desk. The lights are so much fun to play around with infinite possibilities.4. Built like a tank (as discussed above).5. Macros are a breeze to set up. Just make sure the game you're playing allows macros and won't ban you for using them.6. The Razer synapse (the program you use to set everything up) is intuitive and constantly expanding.7. Easily portable and can take to friend's houses to make their set up feel like your own.This product is an 11/10 and I would recommend it to literally anybody and everybody.",
        "My Orbweaver finally gave up the ghost forcing me to use my Tartarus Pro.  Luckily, this coincided with the new Synapse software release.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised at the changes.  My thumbpad now works correctly as an 8 way control and the macro programming has been made much easier and more intuitive. They've added a macro search option (essential when you've built as many macros as I have) which is very handy.  The only glitch I've seen so far is trying to program the \\ into a macro.  It does not recognize the keystroke and defaults to a 3 keyboard command...very strange, but not a deal breaker. Original review is belowI purchased the Tartarus Pro to replace my Orbweaver.  The Orbweaver was starting to have key failures after several years of faithful service.  Programming the Orbweaver was pretty straightforward and easy.  I'd created hundreds of macros for numerous games over the years.When I started to delve into the Tartpro, I hit wall after wall with the new software.  Movement with the thumbpad went from simple to not working in 8 directions unless I emulated an analog joystick.  Getting macros to bind to keystrokes was an exercise in frustration.  It would show the correct macro yet execute the default original keystroke.  For single keystroke macros I could get it to repeat while the key was depressed.  For multikey inputs it would only execute the macro once no matter how many times I tried to make it work.For now, I'm still using the Orbweaver until it totally fails.  I'll keep looking for videos and guides on the Tartpro...if I have a eureka moment I'll come back and modify my review.  This should not be this difficult in comparison to the original programming software."

        "Pros:- LONG battery life. From a full charge, logged 9hrs while working from home and had 77% battery the next day. Great for those who may not be using this headset on a daily basis (or those who are and forget about charging daily!).- USB-C charging connectivity (A to C cable supplied, high quality, long length).- Lightspeed dongle is small and discrete.- Comfort: (YMMV... I'm a male in mid 20s with a medium sized head... I think?) after a few days of playing around with the ski band placement and earcup position, I finally found a setup that worked for me. I have stud earrings and found some higher positions of the earcups were originally pressing on my lobes and causing some discomfort. Switching the band to the larger position and bringing the earcups down allowed me to seat everything nicely without any discomfort. Wore the headphones all day while working from home and forgot I wasn't wearing my usual headphones (Beyerdynamic DT770... Which are my top choice for headphone comfort).- Logi GHub connectivity/customizations are decent. Simple volume, mic volume, sidetone (hearing your voice thru mic with no latency), audio EQ customization (with presets and custom settings)- Doesnt look super \"gamer-y\"... a good plus if I need video on during a (professional) call.- Flip to mute mic is great. I dont like having to deal with a removable mic or a fixed mic. The hardware based muting of the G535 mic is convenient and easy and doesnt require much finger dexterity... Allows me to mute on Discord or Teams while AFK.- Volume wheel and power button are smartly and intuitively placed and sized. Only a couple times have I accidentally brushed the volume wheel with the hood of my sweatshirt, but this only clicks the volume up a notch or two.Cons:- Noise cancelling is pretty weak. No active noise cancelling (but you wouldnt expect that at this price). Not much isolation from surrounding sounds, but this wasn't a large drawback for me as I play in relatively quiet environments- Mic quality: its a 2.4ghz wireless mic, so you have the usual downsides. Reduced high end, thinner bottom end. Its fine! But clarity suffers a little due to the intrinsic qualities of WIRELESS HEADSET technology. Please note that THIS MIC IS PERFECTLY FINE FOR GAMING, WORK CALLS, AND OTHER GENERAL COMMS PURPOSES!- Sound Quality: its fine! I do audio recording and mixing, so I'm biased when it comes to any set of headphones. My Beyerdynamic DT770 have a very wide soundstage, clear highs, articulated bass, and balanced mid range. I spend maybe 12 hours a day using the DT770s and love them for everything (aside from being wired). The G535 are fine for casual gaming, calls, video watching, and music listening. The default flat EQ is very acceptable, and I only tuned it a small amount to increase the high end, soften some mid range resonances, and add some weight in the low end. The stereo soundstage is a little muddy, but all wireless \"gaming\" headsets that I have tried in the past suffer from this- I would liken it to feeling like you are underwater and the sound is surrounding you equally and internally. Again, these headphones are PERFECTLY FINE for gaming, calls, video, and music. I wouldn't try to mix any audio, analyze new music, or try to take in a renowned movie soundtrack with this headset. Again I'm using my Beyerdynamic DT770s as reference here (the cadillac of headphones in my eyes)- they excel at being wired headphones with articulated qualities for music recording and mixing environments (and theyre great for CSGO with their better isolation qualities).- No bluetooth, but I have a pair of galaxy buds that I use with phone/laptop... And I can always throw the USB lightspeed dongle in my laptop and crack out the G535s!Overall verdict: The G535 are my first forray into wireless gaming headsets, and I am beyond impressed by what it offers (especially for $80 on sale)! It is adaptable to many head shapes and sizes (both youth and adult), has an incredible battery life, delivers good audio and mic quality for wireless headsets (better than cheaper $50 random brands), has great controls (both physical and software) without overwhelming the user or offering too much unnecessary functionality - very plug and play. I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone looking to make a worthwhile purchase without breaking the bank (say, the Gpro wireless).",
        "First, these headsets are great for those who use PC or Xbox One to game. I'm sure they can be used on anything that has a jack-in port.Side note for Xbox users: Don't get the dongle version of this headset if you have an Xbox One Gen 1. The USB ports don't work with any dongle devices.As long as I've been gaming, I've never invested in headphones. As far as first pairs go, I think it serves its purpose.The volume isn't the greatest, but I can't say if that's because of Xbox One, Discord settings, or the headphones itself. I don't mind that it has 0 noise-canceling features because it's safer that way. I've learned that noise-canceling devices can eliminate your awareness in emergencies (like if a family member needs help, or a fire happens in the house, etc.). While I know that it's unlikely those things will ever happen for some people, I live in a rough neighborhood where it pays to have all your senses present. Honestly, I can hear my friends just fine with them, but the unit doesn't have an eardrum-shattering volume. Probably for the best.I really like the way the set can be adjusted at the ear muff parts and at the head strap. I also appreciate that the mic can be turned off by just flipping the piece up. The way that the ear parts encapsulate my ears is also a nice feature. It's very plush, which is great for my sensitive ears. I can't use ear devices that insert into my ears--it causes massive pain in under 10 minutes, so having a device that never touches my ears, lets me play longer. The head strap is also a nice feature because it prevents the hard plastic portion from sitting on my head. If you've ever had the weight of a headset sit on your head for long periods of time, you know how much it can hurt.",
        "My background: Saying I game a lot is an understatement. I probably spend about 30-40 hours a week on my pc both for work and gaming. In the last 10 years I've tried multiple headsets with different budgets ranging from $30-$150 until I settled with a budget Corsair headset for $40 for years. Over time I was having issues with Corsair and their build quality. The faux leather/vinyl material they used for the headband and ear cushions was absolutely terrible where it would crack and flake within months. This time I went for a change and decided on this Logitech G335.Pros:- 1 cable does it all. Plug and playI liked my previous Corsair headset that had one cable for everything. This one comes with a 3.5mm that connects both audio and mic together. I did try it with a USB adapter on my PC with no issues and also tried on my PS5 through my PS5 controller again with no issues. Installation was pretty much plug and play. I didn't have to download any filler software although I heard Logitech's software is pretty nice.- Lightweight, Headband and Ear cushions are sturdyThe headset feels comfortable and lightweight on my head, I have not experienced any headaches even after long periods of time. One thing that won me over on this headset was the stretchy cloth headband (is removable in case it needs to be washed) fits nice and snug. My last headset was flaking pieces of faux leather into my ears so I really tried looking for a headset with a different material. The headset does have a very plastic cheap feel but it is a $40 headset. I've dropped it a few times and I've seen no damage, so far so good- Good sound quality and micThe sound isn't studio quality but it's pretty good for the price. I don't notice any difference from my old Corsair headset and HyperX ones I've used in the past. My friends on Discord also said I sound a lot clearer in voice calls and slightly quieter but I think the quiet issue is Discord.CONS- No mute button or removable micThis was one of the features that I missed with my old headsets. The way to mute the mic is by flipping it up and you'll hear a small click. I feel like after many uses it may lead to issues down the road if you mute/unmute a lot. I ended up setting up a Discord hotkey to mute instead. The mic also isn't removable which isn't a deal breaker for me but if you plan to use this on the go, just know you'll have that mic hanging around.-No Sidetone?If y'all don't know what Sidetone is, per Headset Advisor Sidetone is a feature where a small amount of your own voice that's piped into your ear speaker as you speak. Any headset with heavy noise cancellation really needs sidetone otherwise you're yelling into your mic because you can't really hear yourself. This headset doesn't have this feature however it's not fully noise cancelling so it's not a big deal for me. I can still somewhat hear myself but it does block a lot of external noises. Lack of sidetone isn't exactly a con for me but can be for others that feel they absolutely need to hear their voice.Overall this is a great headset for the price. Not spectacular but dang good for $40. Most of these budgets headsets tend to give out after a year so i'll update y'all in about a year. Happy gaming!"

        "I've been using these headphones now for about a month, every day and pretty constantly.  They have decent sound quality and surprisingly good battery life.  They've been comfortable to wear for long-term use.  The microphone seems to work perfectly and is conveniently positioned.  The volume and mute controls are easy to find and manipulate.  The sound quality is respectable but not impressive, as you might expect at this price range.  They materials are certainly not super high quality either, but they also don't feel cheap or like they'll tear or break easily.  These headphones are great for gaming, watching videos and listening to music, but if you're expecting high quality sound you'll be a little disappointed.  I would call these headphones solidly mid-range, but for the price they're perfect.  I'm giving this product 5 stars, not because it's super high quality, but because its quality matches perfectly with the price being charged IMO.",
        "I really am enjoying this headset. The g06 is a really great headset it's I've been using it with my phone and my computer and it works perfect. Great sound quality. Great noise. Canceling the microphone works good. Battery life is great. I mean you really can't beat it for the price. Even some of the higher price ones aren't as good as this one. The buttons on it work great. The design's perfect thank you and next time I get a headset it'll definitely be one of these. If this one ever messes up we just had doubt it will. It seems to be pretty great all right",
        "So I've had these for two or three years now. For the money they're absolutely stellar they're comfortable they don't quite disappear on your head but you do not mind them being there which is very important. Sound quality could be better but for less than $40 you don't have any issues here in anybody walking around you in a 3D environment in gaming. The volume could be a little louder at full volume however it is sufficient. My thing is they work on my gaming consoles but they do not work 100% on my PC. They will play the ambient background noise and the game's music. But you cannot hear anything else. No sound effects gunshots in-game voices any dialogue footsteps you can't hear any of it just the music. I've messed with all my settings I have tried every which way to fix it but something tells me it is in the Bluetooth USB dongle."

        "I’ve only had it for a few days, but I already love it!The design is very minimal and sleek which make it very easy to fit into any room. The material is nice and sturdy with a certain weight to it that will keep it from falling or tilting.Now the actual lamp is the best part. The colors are super vibrant and bright. It is very easy to assemble and once you download the app, is very easy to control.Through the app, you can control a near-infinite amount of customization options on how you want to display the light.There are static light settings, sound reactive, patterns, ambient mode, etc.The coolest features, however, I think is the A.I took which automatically sets lighting settings based on requests AND the community suggestions; where people post their own lighting designs on short videos and with the click of a button you can choose to adopt them to your own lamp.Overall great value for your money and very impressive product!",
        "The Govee RGBIC Floor Lamp is a stunning addition to any space, combining sleek design with vibrant, customizable lighting. The RGBIC technology is a standout feature, allowing multiple colors to display simultaneously, creating unique and dynamic effects. Whether I want a cozy, warm glow for relaxing or vibrant, colorful patterns for parties, this lamp delivers it all.The Govee app is incredibly intuitive and packed with features. From choosing colors and brightness levels to syncing with music, the customization options seem endless. The built-in scenes and DIY modes make it easy to match the lighting to any mood or event. I especially love the music-sync feature, which adds a fun, immersive element to my gatherings.The lamp itself is sturdy, well-built, and easy to assemble. Its modern, minimalist design fits seamlessly into any decor, and the slim profile makes it perfect for tight spaces. The brightness is impressive, and the ability to dim it ensures it’s versatile for any time of day or night.Overall, the Govee RGBIC Floor Lamp is an excellent investment for anyone looking to elevate their home lighting. It’s stylish, functional, and packed with features that make it a joy to use. Highly recommend!",
        "Just set this up today. Super easy to setup, the rubber light part was awesome. And when it was put together it looked really nice and complete and solid, not cheap and flimsy.I already had the app on my phone so adding this lamp was easy. Then real simple click and add it to my main Google home page.The app controls and features are extensive and has a huge amount of really neat stuff. Also I felt it was much easier to navigate then other apps that use color changing lights.Here I thought I needed to buy a 500-1000$ electric fireplace to get that cozy feel....and all I needed was this lamp, fire and flame settings and patterns easily turn the entire room into the same thing a fireplace does.Came back to see if I can find thus exact light, but in a table top size for the night stand 😁"

        "I was looking to replace my wireless mouse. I had a Bluetooth wireless mouse for a few years before it just gave out. The mouse cursor just wouldn't move on the screen and it didn't matter if I changed the battery or try to fix it using some Reddit source, nothing worked. I researched wireless mice varieties to try and find a great replacement and after talking with a gamer, I decided I didn't actually need something that was wireless. I am so glad I went with this mouse! I love the design, it is so sleek and I love the green accent. It lights up when you use it. It's just really pretty. But the connectivity is far superior to a wireless mouse. The ease of use and the reaction time of the mouse is far superior to a wireless mouse. I also don't have to worry about that mouse cursor freezing or unresponsiveness because of the Bluetooth capability. The buttons are also very responsive and handling the mouse is very comfortable. Overall, if you want a reliable mouse, be willing to pay for reliable mouse. This one was worth it and I do recommend it!",
        "Bought this mouse originally in 2015 and I'm buying again nine years in the future as a replacement after my scroll wheel button (not the scroll wheel itself) finally stopped working, and incredible piece of tech for the price.",
        "The Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse has been an excellent addition to my setup. It works flawlessly, providing precise and responsive tracking that’s perfect for both gaming and everyday use. What really impressed me is how well the mouse glides over my wooden table without the need for a mousepad. The feet are incredibly smooth, allowing for effortless movement across the surface with no drag or issues.The ergonomic design is comfortable for long gaming sessions, and the build quality feels solid. It’s lightweight, but still durable enough for heavy use. For the price, this mouse offers exceptional value and performance. If you’re looking for a reliable gaming mouse that works great on almost any surface, this is a perfect choice!"

        "I purchased this for my son who we managed to get a decent gaming PC for his birthday, and after buying the PC, monitor, and wifi adapter our funds for the project were running pretty low, so this was the perfect combination of affordability, aesthetic, & functional.  I showed him the pictures and he agreed it was worth trying, and it was a good choice.  Plug and play makes for easy installation, and the keyboard, mouse, and pad all have great stability, the keyboard is pretty quiet since its not mechanical, and no need for batteries as it plugs right in via USB.  No complaints from me or my son, looks real nice too!",
        "The whole package, which includes a multicolored LED backlit keyboard, mouse, and even a headset, is a great deal and we have had no issues with it after testing it for HOURS AND HOURS of very intense 11 year old boy gaming. Installation was simple, it doesn’t take up a crazy amount of space, durable (I’m sure many can relate how boys can get fired up when they’re not winning and a headset or whatever else may or may not go flying through a room if they don’t win their battle royale or whatever the lingo is) and it’s all held up and completely still intact, a true testament to its stability. The headset helps reduce the noise of the other players, which unfortunately doesn’t reduce the noise coming from his room yelling at the games, but that’s not headset problem 😂 all in all, this was a great value for a great product! 5 stars for sure!",
        "It’s a very nice three piece gaming set. Easy to setup and comfortable. The buttons feel amazing and there’s no input lag on multiple buttons being pressed at once. The headphones suck, imo. I bought a different set of headphones. The mouse is nice but I prefer to have side-buttons, which this mouse does not have. The LEDs in the keyboard and mouse are nice, none on the headphones but it’s nice enough for late night gaming and it’s definitely worth the dollar."

        "not gonna lie, when i was looking for something for my arm rests there are a ton that look the same and i didnt have too much faith in ordering this thinking it was going to be thin padding, cheap material, poor construction, not fit, be loose or hang off. BUT i was actually excited when i got these and put them on my chair, i have a colamy atlas the arm rests are 9.25 in x 3.75 in and they fit perfect. the stretch band is much stronger than you think, and holds in place, they are soft and look nice. construction looks pretty good with no loose threads or any seems that look weak. I think these were a good purchase. 3 caution points - 1. i dont know how long the padding will last, ive only had this a short time. 2. the material is soft and comfortable, but the fibers do not all lay in the same direction, like a couch when you can \"draw\" your name with your finger by going up and down and the fibers lay all one way or another and give a different shade of color, no real problem unless you are a high ocd person maybe. and 3. i have 4 d arm rests - if i push my arm rests all the way forward you can tell the strech band on the back of the arm rest is pushing back against the arm rest bar. if you have weak 4d arm rests i can see the pad pushing the arm rest back to center bc the band is very strong. Overall i would buy these again and am very happy with my purchase.",
        "For the price I can't complain. I bought these to add more comfort to my Secretlab Chair. The material is soft and comfortable and added the exact amount of padded softness to my armrests that I was looking for. They fit on very snug and do not slip. The material is washable and appear to be durable. They look great and time will tell how well they hold up, but the material appears to be of high quality. If you are looking for an affordable way of added a little more comfort to your gaming chair, I suggest you give these a try.",

        "I recently picked up the Ozeino gaming headset, and it has exceeded my expectations, especially given its price point. First off, the sound quality is impressive—it offers a well-balanced audio range with deep bass and clear treble, which is fantastic for both gaming and music. I felt fully immersed in my games, and it really highlighted the atmospheric details and background sounds, adding to the experience.Comfort-wise, this headset is lightweight and well-padded, making it comfortable to wear even during long gaming sessions. The ear cushions are soft and breathable, which is a big plus, as some headsets can feel too warm after a while. The adjustable headband also makes it easy to get a secure fit without being too tight.The microphone is surprisingly clear, with minimal background noise. My friends mentioned that my voice came through crisply, which is always a win in multiplayer settings. The in-line volume control and mute function are also convenient features for quick adjustments without breaking focus.Overall, the Ozeino gaming headset offers great value for the price.

        "This thing sucks.It also blows.And the internal battery means you can make use of its sucking and blowing anywhere, without even the requirement of any physical attachments.  It even comes with it's own protection in the form of two separate filters that fit inside the primary sucking attachment.The various accessories allow it to be employed regardless of the size of what you need sucked or blown.It should be noted that, while some moisture seems inconsequential, it seems designed for relatively dry loads.Battery life is something like 15 minutes per charge which, while not phenomenal, seems sufficient to get any single job done.  Recharging is pretty fast - half an hour or less seems to fully charge it from a depleted state.Suction power I'd describe as fine - it feels neither particularly overpowered nor underpowered for most situations.  It's a fine little sucker for most messes I can reasonably anticipate, but the trailer hitch is staying possessed of all its chrome, and the golf ball is staying at the other end of the garden hose.The attachments seem designed for only one end or the other - it moves air in but a single direction, and the distinction between sucking and blowing is made by turning the device around in the hand, and simply using the other end.  There are several attachments, though each one seems designed to fit only one end of the device -  a single attachment isn't used for both sucking and blowing.  That said, the attachments provided seem sufficient for most jobs.The only situation in which I expected to use it but couldn't was on an inflatable toy I wanted to use.  The attachments with nozzles small enough to seal the hole seemed to seat themselves snugly only in the suction end of the device, making it useful for DEFLATING inflatable objects, but not so much for INFLATING them.But as for what must be its most intended use, as a small hand vac for minor dry spills or cleaning out keyboards or the dust inside cases not often opened, it works very well.In short, while it doesn't quite do EVERYTHING I expected, it's still plenty useful and I'm glad to have it.  It cleans up crumbs, dust, and even many cat hairs, taking care of the whole mess without needing another charge.  I'm glad I bought it, and I expect to get my money's worth out of if it. However, though hardly critical, it would be nice if I could also use it to inflate things.",
        "This is a great compact vacuum. It charges pretty quick and assembly isn't too hard. It works really well and used it to clean the inside of my car. The attachments are great for different uses. Like how it's both a vacuum and doubles as a duster too. Small, but powerful. A great value! Only complaint would be, it can be loud. Other than that it's a great product!",
        "This little duster works very well. I'm impressed with it's abilities. Quit buying that expensive can air!! This works just as well plus it vacuums as well. It would be nice if it came with a bag to keep it all in but I just kept the box to store it all."

We re-did their room and this was the perfect addition to keep all their Switch items organized and in one spot. No more need for seperate spaces to keep their game cases the games come in, their case they kept the game cartridges in, their chargers for their controllers or their Switch. Great tool for decluttering and works perfectly. So both mom and sons are happy with it! Worth the money and so easy to use they had it set up within minutes of package arriving.",

        "My husband has almost every video game system imaginable, and storage is a big issue.  I'm always looking for products to help him, especially with controllers because their shape (and sometimes cords) make them difficult to store.  This was perfect for controllers!  It's study and has a lot of capacity for controllers.  It even has cord slots to keep the cords neat for non-wireless controllers, which is a huge plus.  It looks very sleek and modern, which is awesome because controllers are not traditional in style.  It was easy to assemble and is very sturdy.  It is fully loaded and not flipping over.  Headsets do take up extra slots so keep that in mind as you cannot have other controllers in the slot under a headset.  GameCube controllers do not fit well, but everything else, Xbox, PlayStation, etc. fit great.  My husband loves it!",
        "This controller stand is pretty awesome. I was geniuely impressed with the quality of the product. The stand and base is made of metal, and the controller shelves/holders are made out of this thick and quality plastic. It feels like it was made to last, and for only 25$ I really feel like it is worth it. The design of the holders are meant for newer gen controllers like PS5 and Xbox Series X. They fit good and seem very stable. It will hold older gen controllers like Xbox 360, PS3, and PS2 as so far I have checked, however they don't fit as snuggly as the newer controller do. I don't believe the older controllers will fall out randomly or fall if the stand is bumped, but I felt I should note that it was obviously designed with newer consoles in mind. Overall, I love this product and think it makes my game setup look much nicer.",
        "Easy to follow instructions, although it does come with extra parts. No tools needed - like most of this Ikea era stuff, it comes with the Allen wrench needed to assemble if you don't have your own. When you read the instructions and it says Step 3 for example requires 2 screws, and you have 3 of those - you're not crazy, it came with extra enough for you to apparently drop one but only one. Tell em, Spider-man.The base is far sturdier than I expected and sturider than it has a right to be. By comparison, I have a mic stand with a weighted base and it moves around from the slightest usage. I'm not ashamed to admit I've fell on my desk or even slammed my first on my desk - and this thing doesn't budge an inch. It's sitting free on the desktop, not anchored to anything.My only complaint is that I might actually need another one, I have like 4 or 5 other things I could put on it including headsets and controllers."

        "I had the old version of this brand and I hate to say it, but it was garbage. Never cooled my ps5 always overheated and I was scared it was going to break.I am glad to say this new version for this company did amazing there are so many outlets in the front to charge your phone, controller, or your wireless headset. It is also good for if you hook up your own keyboard and mouse. The size fits perfect on my desk and it hold my remote and the usb storage unit which is amazing because the old one had nothing like that. It charges your controller fast and store so many games.The color fits my white PlayStation and is perfect. Functions well barely can even hear the fan. Over I give this product a 5/5 stars it works perfect I totally recommend this for a birthday gift or Christmas gift. I totally recommend this product for PlayStation players price is good for what you get and it is so organized.",

        "I love the stand because it has rgb,usb ports to charge your phone and gaming accessories. I like the fact it can also hold my headset and controls along with my switch which makes it look even cooler in my game room/studio. Would recommend it to everyone.",
        "As a long-time gamer, I have accumulated a lot of controllers and headphones over the years, which are just lying on my gaming table (or on the floor under the table). I also have multiple tablets that I use while gaming to check FAQs. Again, these tablets are cluttered on my table or on the floor.I was looking for something to organize my headphones, tablets, and phone, and the KDD headset/phone stand was perfect.# PROS- RGB lighting: You have your choice of several solid colors or a rotating color effect. I leave the rotating color effect on. Love it!- 3 USB ports: 2 USB-A and 1 USB-C. I use the USB-A to power my tablet and the USB-C to power my phone.# CONS- Setup was easy but required some force to push in the headset column.- Only one headset holder. I think two would have been nice.If it had one more headset holder, I would give it a five. As is, it is probably the best organizer out there for the price, so I heartily recommend it.",
        "It's basic molded plastic. It holds headphones without falling over, but it's difficult to put controllers in while it's holding headphones, the headphones block too much of the controller area. The charging ports work, but relatively low-powered. Fine for charging accessories like controllers, wireless headphones, etc. overnight, but don't expect to fast charge your cell phone or power your tablet/laptop from them. The LED lighting is functional, if garish. The tablet/switch/phone holders exist, though only one is wide enough to hold my phone in a case.In the end, it does what it says that it does, I'm just not sure anyone really needs what it does. I prefer controller holders which can also charge the controller without running a bunch of wires all over the place (and this doesn't even have enough ports to power 4 controllers at once). A headphone hook is nice, but not if I have to take the headphones off every time I want to use a controller (or put one away)."

        "Update at the bottom - the size you choose really does make a difference.I'm typing this review on this pillow right now. I was hoping that this would be more comfortable, but the usable desk area is unfortunately too small to be useful. I tried it with my iPad + magic keyboard combination and I have to position the iPad just right so that it doesn't fall over. Also notice how much space there is between my torso and the laptop in the photo. This is to have a reasonable distance for typing. If I bring it closer like the marketing photos show, it's too close to type on and the arm rests are uncomfortably high for someone my height (5'7\"). I'd love to have something like this where I could bring the pillow close and the desk would extend far enough so I could type. I'll update if I try the small one.UPDATE - the small version works a whole lot better and somehow has even more desk space. This review has been rectified!",
        "As someone who housesits for a living while going to school online, this is one of the best purchases ive ever made. I dont have to worry about where to set up or if they even have a spot to set up my laptop, i bring the spot with me! My laptop does not slide off the pillow, my laser mouse reads just fine on the fabric so i dont have to use a mousepad, there is plenty of room for my legs, i love the pockets on the sides, the laptop is at the perfect height to reduce tech neck. The only reasons i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, was because i don't like the method used for travel packing, and the height where my elbows sit is just an inch or so too high. It is very awkward to try to use ur body to squish it down in order to hook and tighten the single strap provided to wrap it up. I believe a much wider, preferrably ratcheting, strap is necessary and i am worried the loop you hook the strap into is going to rip off soon. I will probably end up purchasing a furniture strap to do this. For my second concern, using it with ur elbows resting on it for long periods of time begins to feel like ur shoulders are in ur ears, causing some tightness or soreness, but that could just be a me issue.",
        "I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this so much.It's super sturdy and comfortable to hold.I only wish it had a handle or something to make it easier to bring from room to room.Otherwise it's a good purchase. I'd buy again."

        "The N NOROCME Cord Management Organizer Kit offers a wide range of options to keep your cables tidy and organized. The variety of choices provided in this all-in-one kit is excellent, ensuring there's something for everyone.One of m,y favorite features is the velcro, which proves to be highly useful for securing and bundling cables. It allows for easy adjustments and provides a clean setup overall. Additionally, the cable sleeves included in the kit offer a sleek and neat appearance, contributing to an organized workspace.The kit as a whole seems durable and should last for a while, which is definitely a plus. One drawback I encountered is the inconsistent sticking ability of some of the pieces. While most components adhere well, a few struggle to maintain their grip, especially the circle pieces that hold chargers, and device connections.Although the cable sleeves are nice, they have limitations in terms of capacity. It would be beneficial if they could accommodate more cables, as this would allow for a more extensive cable management setup.While the kit offers a variety of options, there are a few pieces that may seem less useful or unnecessary depending on individual needs. It would be helpful if these pieces were better explained or omitted to provide a more streamlined experience.The N NOROCME Cord Management Organizer Kit provides a versatile solution for cable management. With a variety of options, durable construction, and the convenience of velcro and cable sleeves, it offers an effective way to keep cables organized. However, some pieces may have issues with sticking, and the cable sleeves could benefit from increased capacity. Despite these minor limitations, it remains a solid choice for decluttering your workspace and is well worth the price.",
        "The amount of options this gives is what makes it work. Certain items like the plastic multi cord holders have terrible adhesion but other items are phenomenal.",
        "I really liked this package of products. It made the process of getting all of my cables for my standing desk together, making it have a clean look. The adhesion on the smaller bits leaves a bit to be desired as one already tore away on the leg that goes up and down. The sticky pad came away from the plastic, so it was more of a design flaw. Over all I'm very happy though."

        "Bought this for my husband as a birthday gift and we both love it! It was just as expected - a good size for holding one pair of headphones, two gaming controllers, and his phone, as well as spots to wind cords and keep them off the desk. Nothing fancy, but definitely helpful. It was easy to put together (a five minute job) and came with a screwdriver to tighten everything down. It's also pretty sturdy and doesn't tip when you take something off or don't have it holding things evenly. Overall, a solid buy.",
        "I've tried plenty of products claiming to be durable, but they usually turn out to be made of cheap, lightweight plastic or acrylic. This device, however, is genuinely high-quality and extremely stable. I trusted it enough to place on a top shelf, holding two new Xbox One controllers and a heavier Xbox Bluetooth headset, and it handled everything perfectly. I highly recommend it!While I'd personally prefer a silver or gold version, which would be easier to see in the dark, the black color matches everything I own and looks great. It also fits a phone vertically with a thin case. Overall, an awesome little device!",
        "Right off the bat I was a little nervous because it came in parts that I had to assemble. However the instructions were REALLY simple. I think there were a total of 3 or 4 steps and as I built it I could already tell the quality of the product.It's really sturdy. It's holds a headset and 2 controllers mainly. Plus if I remove the headset it doesn't fall or lean towards the side of the controllers so don't worry about making it un-balanced.It even has a nice space for me to put my bean boozled for when I use them during stream. The front has a nice space for phones or in my case the remote for my lights.Overall this is a really good product and definitely worth the price. It's a nice solid black so it blends in with my set up."

        "I bought this for my ROG Ally because I sometimes remote play my Xbox or play Xbox game pass games on it and usually get an invite from my friends so this will definitely help with that and I tested this on my Xbox first to determine this voice audio and my friends say it sounds really good.. hearing the game sounds pretty good for $20 earphones and definitely expected less and it's pretty comfortable for a small period but definitely not for long use, well for me I can use these for a long period. But overall so far to me they work perfect and the mic sounds good so that's a win for me but will update if anything happens or if they break down or if anything stops working",
        "For a long time, I had been using a head-band style headset for video and conference calls. I prefer a single ear cup so I can hear my own voice with the other ear. Also, I prefer analog (3.5mm plug) rather than USB or wireless as it minimizes audio delay. I was getting tired of how the headband felt on long calls, and the way the headset looked bulky on video. I searched on Amazon and the Turtle Beach Battle Buds looked like a good solution, in fact the only good solution I could find. They come with many different sized ear tips and ear fins, but the default ones were immediately comfortable to me. By the way, you don't need to use the ear fins at all if you don't like them. The first thing I tested were the microphones. The pinhole mic built into the volume control was acceptable but not crisp. Then, I plugged in the boom mic, which is the main feature of these ear buds. It is fantastic! I couldn't ask for anything better for the voice quality: crisp, detailed, natural. The ear bud audio quality for listening to voice is unremarkable in a good way... not boomy, not harsh... just right. I tested on music (which is not how I'll be using these) and it is pleasing with good bass. Conference call audio from Teams, Zoom and others is monoaural by default, so I simply put in the left ear bud and leave the right one out: I get the one-ear config that I like so I can hear my own voice. I've been sitting here with the left ear bud and boom mic for about an hour now and I'm feeling no fatigue. Don't let the gaming branding scare you off for using these for business purposes. The design is classy and subdued, the mic is great, the ear tips are comfortable, and I won't look like Lobot from the Empire Strikes Back on my calls anymore. Thanks Turtle Beach!",
        "The build quality is meh, wasn't expecting too much though and feels decent enough for $30. It would be nice if the audio cable was detachable to be replaced but it's expected that something marketed at this range wouldn't do that.For the buds themselves, the audio quality is decent. Honestly, better than expected. The bass is a bit too prominent & slightly muddy in my opinion, the high end gets drowned out a bit but it doesn't have the annoying quality that some cheap earbuds do where mids are way too pronounced. Overall acceptable sound and I'm sure it sounds fine for gaming with footsteps being easier to hear.The microphone surprised me. It isn't amazing by any means but is detachable which is nice to see. It picks up my voice pretty well for only reaching partway down my cheek. Bendy, too, so you can position in whatever way sounds best. It definitely sounds like a gaming headset mic but not the worst out there. On Discord it sounded surprisingly clear even after Discord's noise suppression removed the sound of some fairly loud desk fans i had running.Overall these are worth it imo if you just need a pair of earbuds with a decent mic attached to play some games or chat online. If raw sound quality or listening to music is more of a priority then there are other earbuds out there for less money than these with better sounding drivers.I'm not super hopeful in regards to the longevity of this set as I've had poor experience with Turtle Beach build quality in the past, so I'll update this review if they end up falling apart."

        "Just note, I'm a gamer, I don't do programming and all I do with my keyboard at home is chat with friends, play games or sometimes type up documents. I rarely use function keys like home/end/pgup/pgdn etc etc. I'm the type of guy that is ok as long as we have the F-keys and arrows keys available. I'm not a big backlit keyboard guy, nor do I really care of being fully customizable program or hardware wise.So I've been looking around keyboards, buying and returning, or keeping it and disliking it by the time the return window is closed for around a couple of years now. I've touched a few of the cheaper brands, the logitech wireless G915 low profile, Ducky Keyboards, and the Asus ROG Falchion. General review was logitech feeling sort of cheap, ducky keyboards were wired :'(( , Asus Falchion was way too compact for me (not an ASUS issue, just \"it's not you it's me\" issue) and the metal back plating reverbed with metallic sounds when typing.Ducky keyboards were honestly really good but they do not have any wireless options that I know of which, as a person who wants as minimal cords and wires visible on the desk, it was just a no-no. I couldn't settle myself to seeing the keyboard wire stretching all the way to the back of the desk, even with those aesthetic cords.I was hesitant on getting this Azoth keyboard as the Falchion wasn't that great of an experience. I preferred the cheap felt G915 over the Falchion, which I don't mean to disrespect either keyboards/manufacturers, but they both had their pros and cons. The G915 cons were more forgiving in comparison to the Falchion, but I just decided to give it another go for this keyboard and I definitely do not regret it the slightest.The Azoth keyboard is amazing on the physique, it feels really heavy and solid, the snow switch is quiet but has the most relaxing and satisfying tactile and audible feedback. They completely solved the issue of the backplate reverbing metallic sounds as they described and they really isolated the sound of the keys. The snow switches sound so soothing, I made my friend listen to the keyboard and she's the type to judge harshly, but even she was like, \"Oh my god, that sounds so good.\"The keycaps feel pretty nice too, unlike the G915 I have. The G915 felt flimsy, as it was low profile, but there were reviews talking about the material and build for the keycaps. I did feel it was cheap but didn't think much about it. I used the keyboard for about 6 months and as I sweat a lot on my hands, it does give a toll on the keyboard. The w-key's black coating/paint was chipped and as much as it doesn't affect the performance of the keyboard, it was disappointing that the keycap coating chipped after not even a year. This Azoth keyboard definitely has a keycap that feels more solid and I definitely do not feel it'll be chipping anytime cause of my hands sweating so much. I'll update the review if it does go under my expectation but, I can already feel it's going to meet my expectation.The customization is really in-depth and there's a lot of lighting patterns you can customize to. The top right OLED display is pretty nice, kind of hard to see when you set your keyboard on the desk but that's whatever. You can put any picture you want on the top right display, which is pretty awesome. The control knob isn't bad, it's very easy to control but it'll probably take time for me to get used to. Yet, as earlier I explained, I haven't really checked in depth cause I don't really give a care for these but I'm pretty sure if you enjoy these details, you'll have quite a bit of fun.Battery life, I'll be honest, I fell in love with this keyboard the moment I started using it, I'm only on day 2 writing this review, so if I experience anything in the future, I'll come update but if there's no update, I'm probably still with this baby with no complaints for it being unreasonable.**update/1.5month - The battery life is long enough, I have the OLED screen on, dim backlighting on and I probably charged it maybe twice throughout this span. Definitely good battery life.They also have customizable keys, lubes and what not, so if you're interested in changing keys, lubing keys or doing customized keyboards, maybe this might be a good way to start since it lets you do some maintenance on your own? It seems to be a good introductory/starter kit for if your interested in the customizing the keyboard physically.Only a few cons I can think of right now, such as how the ArmoryCrate UI (the keyboard program on the PC) is pretty jumbled and hard to maneuver around in my opinion. The other one might be the connectivity switch being a small hassle because if you charge your keyboard while using it, the keyboard must be swapped to the wired setting from the wireless setting or it won't connect properly. Yes again, just have to get used to it and if the battery life is long, how many times will you be doing this procedure? Not much so depending the battery life, this QoL issue may be very miniscule.***update/1.5month - It definitely is very miniscule, because of the good battery life and rather, it doesn't bother me that I have to change positions of the switch. There's three modes, wireless, wired, and bluetooth. I don't use bluetooth so I just had to remember two modes, the switch to the left is wireless, the switch centered is wired.*3months update:I found the one, is all I can say. I usually start looking around Amazon for different keyboards on the market because I feel there's something always better, but I've yet to browse the market. Which really says a lot because I feel I was always on the hunt for keyboards. It seems I found my one true keyboard before I found my one true love LOL.",

        "I got this for my man and he loves it. He now has his controllers organized and a place for everything!",
        "This is a nice, very pink, gamer controller tower that lights up and also allows you to charge some of your devices. I appreciate that it can hold up to 4 controllers as well as a headset. Assembly is very easy, instructions are easy to use and this does not wobble or move even with controllers and headset on. The only downside is that I do not like that you cant really adjust the positions of the controller holders and depending on your headset there position can be a little bothersome when trying to take off/on your headset or controller. They can easily fall off the holder possibly damaging your controller.However I have used this as more of a display for my spare controllers and headset so I do not have to move much off of it, but keep in mind when taking stuff off especially the headset it can knock your controllers off, its basically a very crowded stand. I do like the different light effects that go through the whole center piece to the base of the tower which is nice if you like a lot of lighting effects in your gaming area. I very much appreciate the extra USB and USB C port to charge your controllers/headset while not in use.This does feel a little more cheap than other stands I have gotten so I do not leave this on 24/7 only on special occasions, I also do not rely on it for charging my items so I do not know the longevity of lights and power, I mostly just use this stand for storage/display of my extra items. Overall I am pleased with the organizing/display this tower has provided for me and what my needs are, but long term use to the full effect I do not know, but I do think this is a great starter stand for kids, those looking to test out how they like the tower feel or just looking to organize the game room.",

        "The keyboard mouse combo was delivered sept 16 2024. There is a lot I like about this product. The keyboard feels good to type on, and the mouse has good performance. For basic use these are good items. I would say that if you are a gamer, the mouse had some intermittent issues with response. NOT for gamers.All of that could lead to a good review except for a few glaring problems.1. The battery life on the keyboard is not comparable to other products. It lasts a few days, which is good, but there are other similar products that get better life.2. The keyboard has had intermittent issues where it will just stop working. This is not battery related. The fix has been a combination of restarting the keyboard, reseating the USB, or at times restarting the computer altogether.3. The mouse is dead. Did not last even 2 months and nothing I have done has been able to fix it.While I will be contacting customer support I don't have much hope for a decent resolution. Average customer support sucks in this day and age. I will edit this review with that experience at a later date.As of now, I would not recommend or buy from redthunder again.--Update--Redthunder was initialy kind enough to reach out and offer full refund. Awesome... right?No.I accepted, to which they then sent a canned how to on fixing a keyboard. wait, sorry, one little piece about fixing a mouse that wont pair. As my mouse is dead and wont turn on (yes I know how to charge it), neither of these will work for me.Still no refund.Had they not reached out, or said \"sorry, past the return date\", I would have written this off. But I despise people/companies who promise one thing then dont fallow through. Or just ignore in this case.One star. Horrid customer service, bad business, worse product... Do no purchase."

        "I am using this mouse primarily for gaming, so features like sensitivity control, comfort and latency are important for me.This mouse does all of these well. In fact, I think it would be easier for everyone if I just list the few minor things I don't like:The texture on the right side of the mouse irritated my pinky a bit, but I either got used to it or started holding my pinky differently so I do not really notice anymore.The \"rapid fire\" button only does three click bursts. I cannot even find a way to change this in the reddragon software -- you can change the function of the button, but the rapid fire can only be done in a 3 click (or shot, in an FPS) burst. You can even change things like the speed of the burst, but not just have it go full auto clicking when held down. I would often use this button for example in games where I am managing an inventory to rapidly sell large quantities of items -- I now have to click (although only 1/3 as much as I normally would), but this still gets annoying if I am trying to dump say 100 things. My old mouse with true rapid fire would drain stuff in a second.****The downloadable software is pretty nice. You can map any button to any function and control the LED colors and patterns. The mouse stores 5 DPI settings that you can customize both in DPI scale and the color that it illuminates the mouse wheel.I was really worried about latency too, but there is no perceptible latency for me when using it wirelessly. I as a disclaimer, I do have my PC and the wireless dongle only about 3 feet from the mouse at any given time, but so far it has seemed effectively instant to me.I also have large (specifically wide) hands and this is still pretty comfortable. No more soreness than any other gaming mouse I have used after long use.I have not truly tested battery life but after a full charge, I used the mouse for about 8-9 hours in eco mode (RBG off) and was showing 90% battery life in the app.All in all, this seems to be a great mouse by any standard, let alone at the price point of $30-40. I do not think a more expensive mouse would increase my gaming experience in any way. I have only had the mouse for a few days though, so the only thing to worry about is its longevity. If the mouse stops working or acting weird, I will update this review accordingly.Edit 4/18/24: just wanted to add a positive comment about battery life. I have been using the mouse for about a month in ecomode. I use it nearly everyday for 3-4 hours and am just now charging it for the second time (the software says it is at 40%). That's definitely better than I expected when I purchased. It's USB-c so you can use whatever USB-C cable you want, and it does not have to be the one included. It will still function wirelessly while being charged. Bringing this up because I used a wireless mouse once that would shut off when charging and the only way to use it was to plug it directly into the computer while charging -- this one can be used with any power source. Very happy with that",
        "I know a lot of people pass on this brand just because they're a \"budget\" brand (including myself)But I've heard nothing but good things about them so I decided to try one out and I'm really surprised.I'd say these are some of the best mice in this price range. You get a good amount of features you'd find on the premium gaming mice. It feels good in the hand, glides good, works on random surfaces without a  mouse pad and it looks pretty cool.Battery life is also really good, it sleeps when inactive after 1 min or so (maybe less) you'll get a lot of use out of one charge.The only con is that it feels a bit small to me and I dont have super long fingers or anythingnot a deal breaker but might be for others.Over all it's still an awesome mouse and I'd suggest it to anyone that doesn't want to spend $150 for a gaming mouse",
        "I recently had to bid farewell to my trusty Redragon Vampire Elite mouse, and after a moment of silence, I welcomed the Redragon M991 Gaming Mouse into my life. Let me tell you, it's been quite the upgrade! As an artist who adores vibrant colors, the RGB lighting on this mouse is a dream come true. It’s like having a mini disco party at my desk every day! The colors are not overly flashy, just enough to keep things interesting and make my workspace a bit more fun.Setting up the M991 was a breeze—just plug in the dongle, and you’re ready to play. The mouse comes in a beautifully packaged box, making it an excellent gift choice. Seriously, if you want to impress someone without breaking the bank, this is the mouse to get. The packaging alone makes it look like you spent a fortune.Enjoy the pictures, my goodness, I took the picture and when I uploaded it I saw how dirty it looked, so I cleaned it and added another one, there you go. I have had this mouse for two months, it is worked hard, all day every day, so far, no issues, still working great.Performance-wise, this mouse is no slouch. With 19,000 DPI, nine programmable buttons, and a rapid fire key, it’s perfect for both gaming and detailed design work. The buttons have a satisfying click without being too stiff, making it ideal for long sessions. Plus, the ergonomic design ensures comfort, even during intense gaming marathons or long hours of work. All in all, the Redragon M991 has brought a delightful splash of color and efficiency back to my desktop. Highly recommend!"

        "I recently purchased this Xbox controller and headset stand, and I must say, it's a game-changer for my gaming setup! Not only does it perfectly hold my controller and headset, but the additional slots for my TV remote and phone are incredibly convenient, keeping everything organized and within reach. The two charging outlets are a brilliant addition, allowing me to charge my devices while I game without needing extra adapters or extensions.Despite its numerous features, the stand has a surprisingly small profile, fitting seamlessly into my gaming area without taking up too much space. Its design is sleek and doesn't detract from my overall setup aesthetics. This stand has truly enhanced my gaming experience by keeping my essentials organized and charged. I highly recommend it to any gamer looking to tidy up their space and add a touch of convenience to their gaming sessions. An absolute must-have!",
        "Holds everything and keeps it organized.",
        "The only issues are that it needs the weight of a switch or something in the front to keep it from tipping over and it’s hard to get to the lower controller when both are on the stand. So out the one you use the most at the top."

Good thing I have a black one so no sweat off my brow, but still know that some have special colors or wraps and think that the white hub would do great! Totally recommend!!",

        "I've spent so SO. Much on \"high end\" headphones and nothing beats these, not even the higher type of Quantum headphones can beat this.It's LIGHTWEIGHT because it's plastic, yes PLASTIC but the higher end headsets are HEAVY and squeeze the LIFE out of you.I can wear these for 9+hour streaming sessions and the mic is LITERALLY better than my yeti it's SO clear and so just WOW.The sound quality is ALWAYS amazing with JBL, all their items are centered around high quality sounds so you know no matter what you get good stuff with them in terms of sound be it for game or music.The mic is detachable and still sounds A-maze-ing l, again, as good as my yeti with a lot less messing aroundBest part about a detachable mic is I can listen to it as normal headphones for music without a mic getting in my way.BUY IT.(NOT COMPATIBLE WITH XBOX",
        "On par with high end headsets,  light and roomy they may lack bluetooth connectivity but it's not an issue if you don't need to take them away from your  computer or console .I own various types of over the ear headphones ranging from avantree, audiotechnica, sennhiser, samson, to logitech etc... you get the idea... now my personal choice are the open-back style headphones becasue they offer a much better sound stage experience and they are great for localization when gaming tho terrible if you use them when other people in the room the sound leak can be annoying.So recently I wanted to try the JBL brand  and hear for myself what the fuss is all about. I ordered 2 mid range models the JBL Tune 710BT (meh!) and the JBL Quantum 350 and while I didn't expect much from a non bluetooth headset  the JBL Quantum 350 are impressive to say the least, they remind me of my Audio Technica AD500X and the M50BT with just the right amount of bass, the clarity is just as good. Also the sound stage is great for a closed back model. Bouns! the software included  has equialization capabilities.They could improve the pads and the mic clarity but is just fine for gaming. not an issue either I always get better ear cushion for my favorite headphones anyway.pro tip:  On Windows make sure 'audio enhacements' are NOT enabled.",
        "I like the comfortability of these headphones although, you have to get the setting of them just right for it not to uncomfortable. The sound on these is great however, and definitely worth the money in that aspect. Hope it helps!"

        "I have used many different mounts for various setups I have done. I must say I am very impressed. First things first, the price. The price is very moderate for a dual monitor stand.

Everything was in individual compartments as well as having all hardware needed and a very good manual that is easy to understand.  Star number two goes to quality, materials and construction was well selected and used appropriately which leads into the next star.  Star number three goes to engineering, whom ever the team was that designed this mount obviously was wanting to make a point.  The maneuverability and adjustments that can be per personal preference is just perfect not to mention the sturdiness of the arms and mount. Now the mount is simplicity at its finest.

Final tidbit of engineering accolades for the ability to mount two usb ports in the front of the base if you so desire and decent cable management.  Star number four goes to aesthetics, sleek balanced symmetrical design that is extremely functional as well as just pretty.  Star number five goes to price, this mount is priced at an amazing price point considering the quality, performance, engineering, and looks . This is a premium dual monitor mount for a sub premium price.  Final thoughts are I am hoping they make a three monitor mount of same quality so I can acquire it for my next build . I will be using only HUANUO mounts when I redo my streaming room( in the process of remodeling).",
        "These were easy to assemble and have been working well. I bought a laptop connection for one arm and a larger monitor on the other. I like that they move independently and I don’t have to have two screens for balance. Decently priced and solid materials- so 2 weeks in and it still works :-)",
        "It's sturdy, stable, just the right Size, plenty of screws and hardware to mount.I am pleasantly surprised by this dual mount and what I was able to accomplish with it.Using two new 24\" Panasonic monitors, I was able to achieve the clean look and adjustability I was after.What surprised me the most was the three different options you have to mount the base to your desk. 1.) clamps that go on the back of the mount, 2.) direct to the base with the two thread studs with the rubber clamp ends, 3.) A single stud and wing nut anchor system.The latter two options require holes in your desk, and if they aren't there, you must drill the holes yourself.Now, my mounting issue came from the fact my desk is more of a larger built piece of furniture. My OCD didn't allow me to move the base in a spot to utilize any of the provided mounting systems. I could have used the provided clamps, but would have had to cut the desk to recess them in order to make sure the desk went flush to the wall.In order to achieve what I was after, I  drilled two new holes in the base for lag bolts to go through and into the frame of the desk. The base is more than likely aluminum, so drilling the holes was extremely easy to to do even with cheap harbor freight drill bits.The other item I modified was to purchase an offset adapter in order to get my monitors to go back flat against the wall (last two pics) when I have extended periods of non use. The offset was neccissary with the location of the base coupled with one monitor being in landscape view and centered on the desk. If you have both in landscape, and want to achieve a similar setup, you will need the offset adapter as well.With this kit I appreciated the options to hide your wires almost completely for a very clean look. The covers were a bit hard to remove as some had stated, but once you figure it out, it's simple to do.Some stated that the arms were stiff. This is true with no weight on them. I suggest using the packaging binding straps on the arms when you mount it to keep it balanced while you figure out your configuration.There is a tension adjustment so make sure you adjust those after you install the monitors so you can adjust them accordingly without sag or upward drifting.There seems to be plenty of tension, but only for modern, lightweight monitors. If you feel your monitors are beefier, or older and heavier, you might be disappointed, but I would still give it a try.When mounting the monitors to try and configure your setup, take your time and be patient so you don't strip the screws, use too long of screws provided in the kit, or damage your monitors.Ultimately, if you are handy and OCD like me, you can make this mount work to fit your needs. If you have issues with it, you either had the unfortunate luck where you got a defective unit, or you didn't read the directions well before starting."

The RGB matches my desk setup and PC case lighting, so that’s a plus. I haven’t used the USB ports but at least if I need power I know I can plug and go.",

        "The Luna controller looks similar to the Xbox and Switch Pro Controller. And let's give credit to where credit is due, Sega is the one who pioneered this controller scheme. But the Luna is ridiculously comfortable and smooth. It has a better d pad than the Switch Pro, and closely on Par with Xbox's. A good d pad is strangely not the easiest to find. Everything just feels nice on this unit. Buttons respond snappy and the joysticks just have the ideal feel.If you use this with Luna and the WiFi setup mode, there is definitely close to no LAG and that is definitely a big reason to have it. I have been Streaming games for a while now with Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, Vimm's Layer, and some of the others. Luna definitely takes the cake for reliability. I've played some hours without a hint of refresh.One of the only odd things, is that it does take AA batteries and not rechargeable. There is pros and cons to this but still seems backwards this day and age. Microsoft does it too, so I can only fault Luna so much for it.I would just like to see more, unique games across Luna. To make it stand out from Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, giving it more reason to why you need it. The tie in with the GOG library may end up being the killer setup. So, far it's just a good handful of games, I few that I own and it does increase every month. If they go hardcore on that, it's going to be something special. Till then, the Luna Controller and the streaming is a top tier option for no download gaming on the go.",
        "I picked this up at 43% off as an early Prime Day deal and at that price it's a no brainer. If it works as advertised concerning connectivity to wifi and Bluetooth I'd say it's worth full price, easily. That said I'm using this as a wired controller and have only used wired controllers all my life. That's not going to change soon as my gaming set up is intimate and as of now have no reason to test this controller otherwise. So I'm reviewing this as a $39.99 wired controller, not a $70 controller with expectations of all the bells and whistles being on point. And as a controller itself its the best I've ever used.Due to a disability I am unable to use a mouse for PC gaming so a controller is a must. I've used Playstation style controllers and Xbox style controllers in the past but would always return to my chunky, wide and dated Mad Katz controller. It worked, could take abuse, and I had gotten used to it over years of off and on gaming. Like driving a familiar car that's perfect for me it just made sense. Well that controller finally quit on me from extended cord abuse over the last couple of years and unless I want a used one from ebay at least a decade old, I was buying new. I'm a Luna founding member so have been aware of the platform and controller for some time. Seeing the controller was on sale and being a Prime member there was no reason not to get this controller. I've had experience with others to one degree or another and knew I'd have to get used to change. I was missing my broken Mad Katz just thinking about the other controllers I'd used and boxed away over the years in it's absence, as it too was absent for awhile. I expected nothing of the Luna controller but for it to be a reliable, fully PC compatible wired controller. But seems I got more than I bargained for in ways I did not expect as this controller fit me like a glove right out of the box. No acclimation needed, games I've spent hundreds of hours playing with the same controller felt just as well and better using the Luna controller. I've use an Xbox and PS controller in the past and they just didn't feel quite right in hand. But for me at least the transition to this controller was seamless and satisfying.A very well weighted, comfortable, aesthetically pleasing controller made from good materials and solidly built, it operates flawlessly and accurately and is a pleasure to hold in hand for hours while gaming. You don't really notice it's there. Which is exactly what a controller should feel like. Not there. Perfect comes to mind.",
        "Gaming experience  : 5 starsDesign  : 5 starsSetup  : 3 StarsUser friendly  : 3 StarsFirst of all, this controller is very comfortable to handle and provide smooth game play in wireless mode. There is no doubt that this is a good controller for gaming. After that, Luna controller's design just taste different compare to all other major controllers. You will love it once you get it and have hands on it.But the limitation of this controller is pretty significant too. The seamless pairing to your PC only works for Amazon Luna site. You can setup blue tooth connection for Steam games or so, but your first attempt will probably fail. Cuz you have to wire Luna controller to your PC for first time so your PC can download necessary drivers to support wireless mode. But usb c cord is NOT included in the controller box. And this is not done yet. Week later of wireless game play, you will surprisingly find out that Luna controller doesn't get charged in wired mode. Because it uses AA BATTERY !! I'm now buying rechargeable AA battery, hopefully the controller can charge battery directly. Otherwise I need to use AA battery charger to recharge.With all words from above. I can conclude, Luna controller is good for game play in wired mode. And its wireless mode just give you lots of headaches. No wonder why people say it's not worth it with its price.I still like my Luna controller due to game experience, and controller design. But for those who are browsing, be careful and see if you still want it."

        "**Review for Dual Monitor Setup**I recently purchased a dual monitor setup, and I'm thrilled with the experience! The screens are vibrant, offering stunning clarity and excellent color accuracy, which has significantly enhanced my productivity. The dual setup allows for seamless multitasking, making it easy to work on projects while keeping important information visible at all times.What truly stands out is the great price. I was pleasantly surprised by the value for money, especially given the quality of the monitors. They are reliable, easy to set up, and the adjustable stands make it simple to find the perfect viewing angle.Overall, I highly recommend this dual monitor setup to anyone looking to boost their workspace without breaking the bank!",
        "These monitors have excellent quality, along with excellent resolution in the monitor itself. Does a perfect job for my needs and exceeds my expectations.",
        "I work from home and was using a laptop. This became an issue so I got these 2 monitors to connect to the laptop. They work great, give me a nice clear view and make my job that much easier to do!! It was a great deal too!"

        "It took me a while to decide on purchasing this controller and I was a little hesitant after seeing all the reviews, however, I am not disappointed.  My biggest concern was the loose throttle levers and I am still concerned that these will loosen further with more use, but so far, they are working fine.  The latest firmware update and utility software that has been released in Feb 2022, has fixed a number of the issues, and reverse thrust is now working with the changes to the setup in MSFS, as recommended on the support website.  The display panel with the warning lights is also working but the utility software needs to be installed for this, and please note, this is only working for the PC version for now.  In comparison to other more expensive controllers, yes, the build quality is not perfect but it is still good and has some advantages.  The pull levers were my main reason for getting this controller to simulate the controls that are in most prop engine aircraft, this is not found on any other controller.  The trim wheel works perfectly too.  Overall, this is great value for the price and I am 100% happy with it.  I am also only using this controller on my PC and not on my Xbox.",
        "This yoke / throttle combo is a MUST have for the budget minded flight sim player. It works both on PC and on Xbox (1 and series I believe), it has the hall effect sensors on the yoke so it will last hopefully a lifetime as long as it's kept clean. This Turtle Beach VelocityOne control system is SO nice, it's totally programmable, it has default settings for MSFS 2020 - and probably X-plane and the rest (DCS) of the big name sims.. it is a DREAM compared to a joystick yoke / throttle thing, it is SO much more realistic to use. I have a VR headset paired with my system and it honestly feels like I'm actually IN a cockpit flying as close to real is it gets. I got lucky and it was on sale for 329 when I picked this up, the ONLY other one I was considering was twice the price and you have to buy 2 different units to get the Yoke and then the Throttle separately. I'm sure that's 'better' but this is totally worth the price.",
        "I love this product...works and feels great for ms2020... however, i have some concerns...updating the firmware can be a little buggy...check youtube for tips and tricks.  Mapping within game works well, but using the turtle beach status indicator panel doesn't seem to work at all.  basically the lights for gear, ignition etc...are not mappable and do not work...there is a very very basic ms2020 default setting but the lights still don't work...i can't find much info on how to map these lights or how to troubleshoot the configuration of the profiles."

        "I purchased several of these to attach to the underside of my desk, I wanted to move the power, network, sound, etc. cables for the various electronics I use off of the floor.These racks are nice and sturdy.  They're well made, there were no burrs, sharp edges, etc. on the racks.  The black coating is nice and even and didn't chip or flake off when I installed the racks.  The racks come with a good number of screws and washers to mount them to the bottom of my desk.  I found a long Philips head driver for my drill, and a magnet to hold the screw/washer in place made the installation very easy.The box contains a drill template to help you when drilling holes for the screws.  The seller thoughtfully sent a PDF of installation instructions via email the day after I purchased the racks.The racks hold a lot!  There was plenty of room for power cords, network cables, etc.  I event put a couple power bricks into them and it held everything with no problem.  The design makes it very easy to bring cable into/out of the rack at any point that you wish.All of the cables are up off the floor, managed and out of sight.These were a great purchase!",
        "I’m really proud of myself since I’ve never done a proper wire management but this turned out to be really clean. Originally, I had the usual basket hanging below to keep my wires off the ground but it looked horrible. After I got this product, it made my setup looking so good. Not only it helped managed my wires, it hid all the wires away and setting it up was super easy since it’s just adhesive and no tools required. That was the only downside of it cuz it took 24 hours to let the adhesive settle but the wait was worth it. Once it was settled, it was on there permanently. Did not even budge no matter how many times I pulled and yanked on it while I was working on it. Even though wire management took me hours to do, overall, I’m super satisfied how with everything turned out to be.",
        "My goodness the tape on these things is stronger than a weld. They have worked great for me, and I wanted to reposition them to both be right next to each other as opposed to different sections of my L shaped desk, no luck. Once it’s on, it’s never coming off without cutting it out. I tried heating the adhesive with a heat gun and just gave up. Not a bad review, just make sure you put them where you want them forever."

Whether you're watching movies, gaming, or just relaxing, these light bars significantly elevate the ambiance of your space. Highly recommended for anyone looking to upgrade their TV setup.",
        "This pair of tv backlighting from Govee is an excellent mood and ambience complement to create an exceptional tv viewing experience. I got it for $38.99 during Black Friday.  I have a 55” LG OLED TV and I’m glad that I purchased the 15” version rather than the shorter version because I believe that the shorter version wouldn’t be able to create the effect that I wanted to achieve.  I enclosed a photo for everyone to see and to assist other people in deciding if these RGBIC LED backlights are what they’re looking for.It’s easy to install and the app works great with my iPhone 14 Pro Max.  The timer function is very intuitive and very efficient to a dot.  Please don’t forget to enable the Bluetooth function in your smart mobile device when making adjustments in order for the app to communicate effectively with the Govee lights and the adjustments to take into effect immediately.Some people have reported that the lights get hot.  Mine don’t even after 7 1/2 hours of being turned on.  They were still “very lukewarm” to touch.  They shouldn’t get hot because they are LED’s - a very nice feature of an LED.  They’re also cost efficient.I recommend these Govee lights to create a nice ambient environment wherever you want to use them; either as tv backlighting, behind the bed mood effects, or etc.  Certainly, they have many uses and applications. Be creative!"

        "I have several microphones at home and am just getting started making tutorial videos.  In my first video, the sound quality wasn't great, where I was using a cheap headset to record the sound.  I have lapel mics but haven't tried them out yet and also have DJI wireless mic, but that seems more suited to being mobile.  So, I thought I'd give this a shot for when I make Photoshop tutorials.So far I'm glad I did.  I tested it out tonight and compared it to the MacBook Pro built-in microphone as well as the Mac Studio Display Microphone.  This mic beat both of them hands down.What's in the box:  Microphone, Shock Mount, Boom Arm and Desk Clamp, Pop Filter, Accessory Bag with extra parts, Foam Microphone Cover, USB cable (6 foot), User Manual.First impressions:  Taking it out of the box it seemed like it was built OK, if you judge build based on weight.  I don't expect it will see a lot of moving around, it'll just sit mostly in it's spot on my desk, so it should hold up fairly well.  The microphone itself was pretty lightweight, not like other studio mics I've used in the past for music recording.  The parts are light aluminum and have the feel of a desk lamp of similar style.  The accessory bag has the ring you clamp the microphone on to the shock mount with, some extra shock bands, and an extra pad for the pop filter where it connects to the boom arm.Sound Quality:  Very nice!!!  I compared it to both the MacBook Pro Built-in microphone and the Mac Studio Display Microphone and it crushes both of them.  Granted, the FiFine Mic is close to my mouth when I'm speaking, but you don't hear the fan noise from my MacBook and it's positioned right over the keyboard.  If you watch the video, you'll hear the difference of the three.Obviously, I'm not comparing this microphone to another studio condenser microphone at this point because this is the first studio microphone I have purchased for the intended use of making videos.  But I think that it has an overall warm sound, it's clear, and best of all, it is priced right.I've only used it for about 10 minutes at this point, but the difference is already worth the small investment.  I'll update with additional information as I use it more.UPDATE:  November 29, 2023 - I've been using it quite a lot and it's just super for the price point.  I hear a huge difference in voice clarity compared to the previous mic I used.  It does pick up background noise I noted (a truck drove past my house during a recording), but that's not the mic's fault.  I wish the arm was a little more adjustable because I have it off to the side when I record and it almost doesn't reach where I want it.  I'm sure I'll figure something out in regards to that after a while.  Still love it."

        "Loved the rgb. The keyboard is a bit sensitive yet comfortable and the space bar does squeak a little. The headset is amazing. The mouse feels great on the hand thought i was worried the R/L clickers were too big, it did not hurt its performance at all. It's all wired so no batteries, seller could emphasize that so no one gets confused. The keyboard/mouse pad is of quality. One thing is the rgb strip is a set lineup of colors, i would have preferred a single color since its not programmable it kinda makes my underdesk light up like a Christmas tree but it still makes the set much sweeter. I might have skipped the instructions from the excitement but the rgb programming is simple, i just wish you could dim the lighting some for my poor wife at night. Overall great product great price.",
        "I recently purchased the Game Punk Codebreakers PC Gaming Bundle and it has completely transformed my gaming setup. The keyboard and mouse are responsive and comfortable, perfect for long gaming sessions. The headset provides clear sound quality and the LED XL mouse pad adds a cool aesthetic. The included stand and RGB light strip are fantastic bonuses that enhance the overall experience. Everything in this 6-in-1 bundle works seamlessly together, making it an excellent value for any gamer. Highly recommended!",
        "Everything in this bundle worked as intended. Didn't see much use for the string of RGB lights. Especially when considering how many outlets and plugs it all takes. Otherwise it’s a good choice for an overall replacement for a wide variety."

        "I been using my laptop with a massive monitor lately so I wanted a relatively inexpensive speaker since the monitor speakers were terrible. I could use my headphones but I didn't want to always have to be using headphones. Then I found this speaker and for $25 this speaker was worth every dollar. the pros:1. Very easy setup, plug in the 3.5 mm jack and usb for power and it just works.2. Very tactile volume knob, I sort of love playing with it.3. Very simple design, it looks like a few speakers in a housing and beyond the volume button the top logo changes the rgb.4. RGB is very subtle and for me who dislikes a lot of rgb I actually keep it on most of the time.5. The speaker isn't the loudest in the world but its decent for PC speakers especially if you are sitting in front of it.Now for the cons:1. 2 cords are required for it to be used, not a deal breaker but will add clutter to your desk.Overall I really love these speakers and they work for what I need to do. If you are looking for a cheap speaker type bar then gives these a shot. Just remember you won't be having boom box parties with these speakers.",
        "I needed a simple speaker system.  I have no room for tall speakers and the sound bar seemed like a perfect option.  I also didn't want anything complicated in which I needed to install software to use the speakers.  The Redragon GS560 sound bar is fantastic.  Great sound and it fits perfectly under my monitor. I like that I can cycle through the RGB options with a tap on the top.  Off is an option.The light around the volume control is a little brighter than I like, but that is minor and not even close to a deal breaker.  It does not change color with the lower RGB.Quick note: The first set of speakers had a continuous buzzing sound from the right speaker.  I used the replacement feature on Amazon and Redragon shipped a new one immediately.  I received the new one in about 2 days and it works great.",

        "These are not your average true wireless earbuds. In a saturated market of wireless earbuds, these bring a unique feature that opens up many new possibilities of uses that most people might not even know. If you've ever used bluetooth earbuds and noticed that what you were watching or playing wasn't matching up with the sound, then you've experienced audio latency. Bluetooth in its current state is the guilty party that can cause that effect where the lips don't match the voice. Some might not be bothered by this, but once you see it, you can't stop thinking about it. Some hardcore gamers get around this by using 2.4ghz instead of the Bluetooth protocol. 2.4ghz headphones have virtually no latency whatsoever, but require you use a dongle to plug into your device.These Soundcore VR P10 headphones are hybrids with both functions. The dongle allows imperceptibly low latency. But because they are also capable of using the bluetooth protocol, you are able to connect these to both your gaming device and your phone. While gaming or watching videos, if you get a call on your phone, it will automatically lower the volume on your game or video, while prioritizing your call volume. It's a seamless experience.2.4ghz headphones existed for a while, but until recently, they were mostly over-the-ear style. Personally, I can't stand anything on my head for long periods of time due to the pressure and overheating. There are only a handful of in-ear earbuds with 2.4ghz dongles at the time of this review. This one is the ONLY one that has a passthrough charging feature on the dongle itself. If you use a dongle on a device with only one USB-C port, then you'll have to choose between charging or listening. These dongles allow you to do both. With the battery life of devices like the Quest 2, you'll definitely need to do both at the same time.Non-gamers:If you have a phone, tablet, or laptop that you use to watch movies or shows, take zoom calls, or listen to music, as long as it has a USB-C port you can instantly connect these headphones to your device without fumbling around in the bluetooth settings trying to get it to pair. This is immensely helpful if you constantly switch between using a laptop, a tablet, and a phone. Imagine you are watching a movie on a tablet and you get a zoom call on your laptop. Instead of unpairing and repairing, you just slap the dongle in. Additionally, Anker has stated that more dongles will be available for purchase soon, meaning that you can have multiple dongles, each plugged into a device you use often, and just switch via the app. All the while having low latency.PS5:I've tested it with the PS5. It works flawlessly. Instant connection and no noticeable latency. The sound is very immersive and I can easily tell the direction of footsteps in-game. Additionally, these earbuds finally allow you to use wireless headphones with your PS5. Previously, you had to either use over-the-ear style 2.4ghz headphones, or use a wired headphone plugged into your controller. Otherwise the latency would be preposterous. If you use your PS5 as a media player (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc.) you'll be able to enjoy private listening with wireless earbuds and have no latency. Pair this with a PS5 remote and now you have one of the best and most powerful \"Smart-TVs\" with a private listening function. If you live in an apartment and watch movies, you're probably constantly turning down the volume when an explosion or shot rocks you to your core, and then turning it back up because you can barely hear the whisper dialogue in the next scene. With these headphones, you can peacefully watch your movie as intended, while not worrying about cables, latency, or your neighbors getting mad.Steamdeck:Works exactly as you might expect. I have not run into any issues. Passthrough charging works great. If the sound suddenly doesn't work and you see \"echo-sink-cancel\", then its a bug with the Steamdeck, not the headphones. Restart to fix. Be aware that if you buy the official Steamdeck dock, that there is no USB-C out port on that dock. You may have to buy a USB-C to USB-A adapter for the dongle.Quest 2:These headphones were made for the Meta Quest 2. In VR, if you have any sort of latency, it could make things very disorientating and nausea inducing. These are perfect for having an immersive experience and reducing VR sickness. One cool feature is that if you are using it with the Quest, you can turn down the 2.4ghz signal to prevent interference with your wifi. Since the earbuds are so close to the dongle when you use it with the quest, you don't need the signal to be strong. Also, the quest dies very quickly. These are the only true wireless earbuds with a dongle that lets you charge and listen at the same time. They sound much better than the stock speakers on the Quest 2 and allow you to pinpoint the direction that sounds are coming from. The point of VR is immersion. Audio immersion is just as important as visual immersion.Switch:The passthrough function does not work with a Switch. I believe it's a limitation with the Switch's software. It doesn't seem to allow the one USB-C port to have multiple functions at the same time. The headphones still work beautifully via the dongle, but you won't be able to charge at the same time. Not the fault of the soundcore earbuds though. Maybe it can be patched by a switch software update in the future. If you play in docked mode, maybe try plugging the dongle into a USB-C to USB-A adapter and then into the dock. I have not tried this, but it might work.PC:Not every PC has USB-C ports. Not to worry, I have tested these with a USB-C to USB-A adapter and it works great. If your PC does not have a USB-C port, you will need to buy an adapter separately. Otherwise, all features (volume adjust, low latency) function well.Mac:Works really well. You can even adjust volume with a tap on the earbuds (gesture can be adjusted in the mobile app). Since these are both bluetooth and 2.4ghz, you can have them connected to your phone and MacBook at the same time for the ultimate productivity experience. The sound will come through both depending on which device you are using. Example, Zoom on MacBook to phone call on iPhone automatically.iPad:Also works well. Passthrough charging is quite important since the iPad only has one USB-C port. If you game on your iPad, you'll appreciate it.ChromeOS/Chromebook:Works fine but currently there is a weird bug in ChromeOS with USB-C headphones. The volume will adjust normally up to around 50% volume where the loudness suddenly blasts your ears at 51% volume. Be careful with Chromebooks until they patch this. Keep it under 50% or test it past 50% with them out of your ears.**Cons**With certain devices (Switch, Some Tablets), these headphones are a bit limited. The passthrough charging feature won't work unless your device allows that USB-C port to multitask. So be aware of your devices functionality if you're buying this to use with a specific device.With certain devices (Switch, PS5), adjusting the volume via tapping the earbuds don't work. This is again a limitation of the software of those devices, not the earbuds. On the PS5, it is a painful multi-step process to adjust the volume in their menus. Hopefully a software patch will fix this as USB-C headphones become more popular. On mobile devices like Android and iOS tablets and phones, PCs, and MacBooks, it works just fine.The dongle is kept in the top part of the case via a magnet. It's very easy to put it in, but kind of a pain to remove the dongle since it's recessed so far in. If you have bigger hands, this might irritate you. I suggest taking the earbuds out first before trying to take the dongle out.With the exception of some devices, the headphones work amazingly and sound great. They solve a very niche but very annoying problem. Get them, you won't regret it.",
        "I purchased the Soundcore VR P10 Gaming Earbuds for my daughter’s Oculus, and they have completely transformed her gaming experience! The low latency feature ensures that there’s no delay in audio, making her gameplay more immersive and enjoyable.The dual connection options, including the USB-C dongle, make it super easy to connect to her Oculus and other devices like the PS4 and PC. The sound quality is fantastic—crisp highs and deep bass that really enhance the gaming experience.These earbuds are comfortable to wear for long sessions, and they stay securely in place. If you’re looking for reliable gaming earbuds that deliver outstanding performance, I highly recommend the Soundcore VR P10s!",
        "Pros:- Super easy plug-and-play dongle, Windows automatically sets it up, good to go in under a minute.- Works as advertised! Lighting fast, there's NO detectable lag in gaming, whether VR or 2D.- Great design, the buds and case look much more expensive than $70.- Good amount of options on the Soundcore app.- Good sound quality out of the box, but you can tune it with the app to be even better.- Awesome purple LEDs on the buds. (Can be changed to a few other color options in the app.)- Great battery life. They last longer than my longest VR gaming session ever would.Cons- You'll need to buy a USB-A male to USB-C female adapter if your PC doesn't already have a USB-C port.- Not the most comfortable earbuds I've owned, but not the worst either.- Sound levels on PC could be higher.I have 2 other sets of wireless earbuds from Soundcore, the Liberty 3 Pro and the Life P3, both of which are great, but the Life P3 are very comfortable for longer periods, while I could never get the Liberty 3 Pro to fit comfortably no matter what I did. These VR P10 buds fall somewhere just behind the Life P3, where they feel comfortable at first, but after about an hour of play, they start to hurt my ears a bit. If I move them around a little, it will alleviate some of the discomfort, but you know how some earbuds are so comfortable that you might forget you have them on? Yeah, these never quite reach that point. On the plus side, they stay put and never feel like they're going to work their way out of my ear while playing VR games either, which is important. The discomfort could be from the shape of my ear, so they might be more comfortable (or less?) for other people.Out of the box the sound quality is pretty good for music and gaming, although some might find it to be a little too flat, so I definitely recommend connecting them to your mobile device with the Soundcore app and tweaking the EQ to your taste, mostly when it comes to games. (Bump those low freq's up for gunfire and explosions.) You don't need to leave the Bluetooth connected between your phone and the VR P10's, they will remember the EQ settings even after you disconnect and switch to PC audio output. (For music, I always listen with a flat or no EQ, but I have better earbuds for music listening sessions. I got these specifically for VR gaming only.) My HMD is a Samsung Odyssey+, if you're wondering.I really like the case design and the way the buds snap magnetically into the holding positions, and the white shell of the buds with silver accents make them look more expensive than they are. The LED's are freakin' dope too. (They can be disabled in the app if you're worried about battery life, but from what I've seen so far, they have little effect on battery drain.) The buds are a little slippery though, so make sure you got a grip on them whenever you are putting them away or taking them out of the case.I got a couple of inexpensive USB-A to USB-C adapters, and when I plugged the VR P10 dongle in the adapter and then into my PC, Windows recognized the dongle within seconds, and soon after I was able to select it as an audio output from the sound popup in the taskbar. Easy peasy. No fiddling needed. The only downside is that the buds are a bit on the quiet side, and even though I don't have any hearing problems, I have to push the volume up past 80 to really hear everything while gaming, but to be fair, although 100 (full volume) is easily bearable, that's more than I would ever actually need, so it works out alright."

        "I always feel bad about buying canned air that creates landfill waste. This air duster is the perfect solution. It has several attachments that help me get into small areas, including working on crafts and building miniatures. It is rechargeable, compact, and efficient. I recommend to anyone working on crafts or for keeping handy in the car for cleaning dog hair.",
        "First, I have always has a can of compressed air near my computers. The thought of dust and crap in a keyboard has always been nasty to me so I have a weekly ritual of holding the keyboard over a garbage can and blowing out the dust.  The thing I hated was after a few seconds the can would get WAY cold and sometimes that wasn't enough time for cleaning, especially if I was having a PB&J week. And so a month ago I decided to give this Air Duster a shot. I figured it it didn't blow I could return it. Well, lets just say it does blow, and blows much better then I thought. No, we're not talking air compressor level of blow, but this is easily up with a lot of the cans of compressed air I've used over the past few decades. What's really good is that this duster will pay for itself very quickly.It comes with lots of attachments, holds a good charge, has three speeds and my favorite part, it requires you to hold the start button for a few seconds before it kicks into gear. I can't even count the number of times I've heard hissing in my desk just to find something shuffled and a can of air was letting loose an air biscuit in the drawer. No more of that...even if something does bump the button, it's not coming on! My second favorite part is that I can run this for a long time and my fingers no longer freeze, like with a can of air and it's blow rate is consistent. Maybe not as strong as some brands of compressed air cans, but I will take consistent over the long run any day of the week. Sure it doesn't have that tiny little hose that often would fly across a room, but to me, this doesn't need that (though you could always MacGyver one if you're feeling nostalgic.)",
        "Yes I did lose one of the attachments all were included. Comes with the 3 brushes, 4 blower attachments (one with a brush on it) and a short charging cord. What this works great for is cleaning out dust, crumbs, or small anything from a desk, pc, etc. This does not work for inflating inflatables, blow drying hair, or anything requiring high air flow. This is more designed for fine targeted flow of air rather than a large volume. It has 3 power settings, low medium high, each ramping it up a little more. The included attachments work great to help loosen up pieces of debris that may be to stuck to initially be blow away. Battery life is quite short about 5-10 minutes on high before it runs out. If you using this as a replacement for canned air and use that a lot you would need probably two of these to switch between as they charge. Overall I have liked it a lot for my routine PC and keyboard cleanings. Probably has lots more uses so never know until you give it a try!Summary:Lots of attachments+Good for Dust, Small Debris, crumbs+Rechargeable+Included carrying bag+Not for inflating, hair drying,  or anything high air flow-Short battery life-Noisy (Louder than most hair dryers)-"

It’s my son’s favorite light in his room, the pictures do not do it justice. It’s almost blinding at first, but does light up the whole room and you can see pretty well in it.

        "Very easy to apply, We attached to the outlining of our house and product is shining bright. The app helps a lot with not having to go outside to turn it on or off. Also creating your own color series is amazing.",
        "I bought these for my son’s room, they were very easy to install. Work very well, and we were very happy with the price. They were able to go around his whole room on top and down the bottom edging. I would absolutely recommend."

        "First impressions, they're pretty good, I needed some speakers for my games since I don't want to wear headphones half the time, so I bought these and wow. I know they're cheap, but the RGB lights look nice, sound is great, and easy to set up. Would recommend and will definitely buy another set if I ever wanna upgrade.",
        "Edit: I have meant to update for a while but gotta add a star for amazing customer service. They reached out to me and replaced the items I had issues with. Thank you!Original:I have purchased these twice. The first set sounds amazing. The second set has unbearable feedback unless you turn the colored lights off, which is very disappointing.",
        "It has very good sound quality, along with the volume output, it more that what I needed for my monitor and gaming, and it seems to be cheaper and more reliable than other brands, just a bit smaller than I would've liked as well."

        "I’m a Philips Hue owner and have never cared for Govee products in the past, however the Evangelion crossover and the unique look of these lights persuaded me to buy them.Out of the box these lights are impressive, they’re nice and solid feeling and the magnetic covers look great and give a nice depth to the lights. Hooking them up is super easy once you decide the shape you want. Overall setup is a breeze!Once set up adding them to the Govee app was incredibly easy. The lights have a ton of great function and pattern options right out of the gate. They’re also extremely bright when turned up, and look great when you turn them to about half power.Overall I’m extremely pleased with these. There’s a lot of great little Eva nods on them, they have a unique futuristic/cyberpunk type feel to them that separates them from the normal lights that Philips or Govee normally sell. My only gripe would be that they should include another set of connectors with them. You get a small square and a small triangle connector in this but it would really open up the set up possibilities if we had a couple more.",
        "Outside of a few handcrafted items on Etsy, I don't think I've ever seen LED lights as detailed and 'themed' as these before.  The sheer number of patterns you can get the lights to emulate thanks to all the symbols and grooves is astounding.",
        "Little Pricey to what you get. Plastic magnet covers tend to fall off easy if you bump into them. The strips are a little heavy so time will tell if the double sided tape does not peal off the wall so one might want to invest in a hanger clip system. Had to drill into the wall with hanger clips to provent other govee light products from falling off the wall thanks to orange peal texture walls I have. Over all they are nice and bright along with very cool light patterns."

        "Soooooo cute!I recently purchased the JIKIOU Upgrade Leather Cloud Keyboard Wrist Rest, and it has been a game-changer for my daily computer use. The design is not only stylish but also incredibly comfortable. The memory foam provides just the right amount of support, allowing my wrists to rest naturally without any strain. I've noticed a significant reduction in wrist pain, especially during long work sessions at my computer.The leather surface is smooth and feels great against the skin, while the non-slip PU base ensures that the wrist rest stays perfectly in place, even during intense gaming sessions. I no longer have to constantly readjust it, which is a huge plus. It's also the perfect size for my keyboard, offering ample support without taking up too much space on my desk.What really stands out to me is how this wrist rest blends comfort with durability. It’s clearly built to last, and the materials used are of high quality. Whether you're using it for work, gaming, or just general computer use, this wrist rest is an excellent investment. I’m also considering buying another as a gift because it’s just that good! Highly recommend for anyone seeking both comfort and relief.",

        "This heated foot rest has been a game-changer for my home office setup. The dual-height adjustment lets me find the perfect ergonomic position, while the heat and vibration features help ease tension during long work days. I especially appreciate the double-layer design that makes it sturdy yet comfortable.The heating function provides gentle warmth without getting too hot, and the massage vibration has multiple settings to suit different preferences. It's been particularly helpful during winter months and after long days of sitting. The build quality feels durable and the cover material is easy to clean.If you deal with cold feet, circulation issues, or just want better ergonomics at your desk, I highly recommend this footrest. The only small suggestion for improvement would be a longer power cord, but that's easily solved with an extension cable.",
        "This foot rest met my needs for a comfortable way to elivate my feet from the floor during seated desk work.  I truly enjoyed the feel of the plush cover.  One has the ability to use one of two heights, which is a plus.The heat feature provides additional warmth, but I do not require that feature, especially during late spring to mid fall.I do not enjoy the vibration levels because they are distracting and irritating to me.The appearance is pleasing, including the blackish- dark grey colors.  The material is very lightweight, and the size is manageable, which makes mobility an ease.Overall, there are many benefits to this product, and I suggest that you consider purchasing it for the reasons stated in this review.",
        "I purchased this foot rest for 2 purposes. One is to rest my feet on a higher platform while sitting behind the desk, Two is the heat my feet while resting. This unit perfectly combines these 2 functions. It is soft and warm. It lifts the legs and feet ideally and make them feel rested.The function of massage is an extra. It is a pleasing add-on. It is not super strong as a regular massager but it certainly does the job. It warms the feet while massaging too.I have 11.5 feet and I could have managed to keep them inside the rest easily.The only con can be the length of the cord. To be fair, it is enough for most of the use cases. I only wished it was 2 feet longer for much easier use.Nice product and it does its job."

Lightweight is a plus, bc heavy glasses give me a headache. And I’m also noticing I don’t have anymore eye strain. Such a win and at a great price too! Very happy with my purchase.",

It isn't a super noticeable color difference but you can tell there is one and that they work. They come with a blue light and test card to show the change as well!

        "I recently purchased the Livho 2 Pack Night Vision Blue Light Glasses, and I am incredibly pleased with the difference they have made in my daily life. These glasses are not only stylish but also highly functional, providing exceptional protection against blue light and enhancing my nighttime vision.As someone who spends long hours in front of a computer screen for work and enjoys late-night gaming sessions, I was experiencing significant eye strain and occasional headaches. Since I started using these glasses, I've noticed a remarkable reduction in eye fatigue and discomfort. The blue light filtering technology effectively blocks harmful rays from digital screens, making it much easier to work and play for extended periods.One of the standout features of these glasses is their night vision capability. The lenses are designed to improve visual clarity in low-light conditions, which has been a game-changer for my night driving. I feel more confident and less strained when driving at night, as the glasses reduce glare from oncoming headlights and streetlights, making the road appear clearer and less harsh on my eyes.The Livho glasses are lightweight and comfortable to wear for long durations. They come in two stylish designs that suit both casual and professional settings. The frames are sturdy yet flexible, ensuring a comfortable fit without causing pressure on my temples or nose. The sleek design has garnered compliments from friends and colleagues, adding a touch of style to my everyday look.The value of getting two pairs of high-quality glasses in one pack cannot be overstated. This allows me to keep one pair at home and another at the office, ensuring I am always protected no matter where I am. Considering the benefits they provide, the Livho glasses are incredibly affordable and a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to protect their eyes from blue light exposure.These glasses are versatile and suitable for a wide range of activities beyond screen time and driving. I use them while reading, watching TV, and even during outdoor activities in low-light conditions. They come with a protective case and cleaning cloth, making it easy to keep them in excellent condition and carry them around wherever I go.Overall, the Livho 2 Pack Night Vision Blue Light Glasses have significantly improved my visual comfort and eye health. Their effective blue light protection, enhanced night vision, stylish design, and excellent value for money make them a must-have accessory for anyone who spends a lot of time in front of screens or driving at night. I highly recommend these glasses to anyone looking to reduce eye strain and protect their vision – they are truly a game-changer!",
        "I’ll make this on one stop review for you. Let me start off by saying they’re definitely worth the purchase.First reason is, they’re very good quality. Screws are nice and tight and don’t feel like they’re gonna fall out like other cheap glasses..They got a lot of different options so you could find your style and someone else can find their style.I like how it comes with the blue light and the card so you could see the blue light not being able to go through and it’s perfect for gamers cause gaming. A lot could really damage your eyes and give you a stigmatism so wearing these while gaming to protect your eyes. Or even just looking at your phone stay protected yall.They look really good with the style I got. the appearance fits perfectly for me.They said pretty well on your face. I personally have not had any discomfort with it, but everybody’s faces are different so I could only speak from personal experience with this. But they are very comfortable and when I’m gaming for let’s say three hours I don’t feel like I need to take them off.I’ve had the glasses for about a week and I don’t have a single scratch on them yet but respectfully, I’m not gonna sit here going and scratching my glasses for yall😂 but so far the scratcher resistance is good.Overall, I’d read the glasses five stars because they’re very good quality work for what I bought them for and they come with two which is a plus and it comes with a lot of other stuff so you’re definitely getting your moneys worth and your qualities worth",
        "I bought these glasses on a whim just to see if they really work, and so far they work great. So far, these glasses really seem to help my eyes from feeling strained and tired with so much screen time due to work. I don't think the glasses suit my face, but since I work from home, it works out fine. The price seems reasonable for 2 pairs and the quality seems good so far. They have some cute colors too."

        "I liked what I saw in the product description and judging from the reviews, a pretty decent mic. For the price, even better. Mine was an opened product, appears unblemished. This was a replacement for a generic mic I bought in 2020 that was okay, but this is more advanced and looks cool. More features, better sound quality. The features are great. Love the mute button, turns the lights off and on. Very responsive. Couple other things that sold me on this mic, aside from the great reviews, the gain knob is quite novel. Haven't seen many with such a convenient gain dial. Has a real nice feel to it. The aux audio output is also nice. Adjust sound and light with NGenuity PC app free download from HyperX website. There's some lighting patterns to choose from, speed - brightness - and hue can also be adjusted. There's an option to program presets and export settings to the mic. The plug and play versatility is exceptional. Works with my PC, my guitar amp, my DJI Action 4 camera and my Samsung Galaxy. The included boom mount adapter looks pretty universal. Five eighths or three eighths inch are the options. I went with the larger size for more stability.Alll gimmickry aside, the specs on this mic are at least 'on par' with other leading podcast - streaming mics on the market right now. There are a few that are on the level, of course I didn't see any with the big dial adjustment at the base. The look and feel is very nice. Comes with a sturdy desktop stand and woven nylon USB-C to A cable (recommend having a USB CtoC connection available.) Also, the sold separately HyperX Shield Pop Filter makes the setup even more impressive.As far as improvements, there could be a mobile app for adjusting the mic settings while connected to a smart device - currently there is not. Or perhaps there could be some Bluetooth connectivity. Also, the polar pattern selector knob came loose, but it snapped back on. Totally fine now. Camera quality seems pretty good. Still trying to get it to work as an aux mic with my Bluetooth mic receiver input. It works, but not while attached to the USB on my camera. Although it works while connected directly with USB, I think I'd like to find a solution that can power and connect mic to camera to PC with a single cable. The mic does drain the battery quite a bit with the lights running especially."

        "I’m somewhat of an audiophile; I have higher end home audio, headphones, etc. I don’t game often so I figured I’d grab a cheap pair and update if necessary cuz I really only needed a mic… but I’m very impressed with the build quality, comfort, ease of use and intuitive and functional use of this headset.I was gaming in the 360 days where just any old corded headset could plug into your controller and be fine. These have Bluetooth capability or it comes with a USB for an automatic connection that’s just seemless. They get loud, sound clean and crisp and well rounded with good, deep bass, rich and clear sound.. not muddy. I’m honestly incredibly impressed. They look nice too.",
        "Beautifully built. Sturdy and comfortable. The colour is so cool and the accent light gives it a pop. Performance is outstanding for me as I use it with my PS5, cell phone and also to watch TV. Also the sound is really good. Pairing is so easy as the device shows up immediately to pair to the connecting device. Sound dampening is not bad either. Price point for this quality headphones is great.",
        "The 2.4GHz Wireless Gaming Headset has truly impressed me with its superior sound quality and comfort. As an avid gamer, the immersive stereo sound enhances my experience in games like Fortnite and Call of Duty, providing a competitive edge with clear and detailed audio. The 2.4GHz wireless connection is seamless, delivering uninterrupted sound without lag.Comfort is crucial for long gaming sessions, and this headset excels in that area. The plush ear cups fit perfectly, offering excellent noise isolation without causing discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a snug fit, allowing for hours of use without fatigue.Versatility is another standout feature. The headset works flawlessly across multiple platforms, including PS5, PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch, and the Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity makes it easy to use with mobile devices. The built-in microphone is clear and effective, enhancing communication during online gaming. Additionally, the sleek design, sturdy build, and impressive battery life make this headset a top choice for any gamer."

        "I bought this mouse to play WOW on an imac and I am so happy that I did its super smooth and responsive, the buttons allow for me to program them for different rotations which is a plus. The feel of the material is a soft touch which feels great and helps with grip. This mouse is realty well made and a great product for a good price point. I can play for days without needing to recharge it and when I do its fast charging. the colors really light up and are not a distraction because its a subtle change, I can say enough for the response because it is a Bluetooth device which have a tendency to lag a little bit but not this mouse.  I would highly recommend this product and as a matter of fact I will be purchasing a spare as a back up. Since I game so much I have a tendency to go thru them pretty quickly. I have had this one since June 2024 and so far no issues.",
        "I can’t believe I’ve been playing with a corded set on console for this long when this exists. I play on both PS5 and Xbox Series X and this mouse plugs in and works perfectly. Ps5 registers this as a keyboard instead of a mouse but either way it works fine. I like that it’s quiet and there’s no clicking. I usually play with no lights on the mouse to save battery life but it’s very pretty when it’s on. Feels nice in your hand. Good purchase.",

Awesome anyways,",
        "I love the feel of the keys and the build quality for this price range. Amazing really. I believe this has the red switches so be sure you like a klacky sound that won't bother the neighbors. I love the sound.",
        "I purchased this for under $25, so I will review as such.  I got the yellow keycaps with blue switches.One of my hobbies is to buy dirt cheap mechanical keyboards and mod/improve them as much as I can.  Sometimes I fall in love with them, other times I just give away as custom made gifts.This caught my attention because it is pretty rare to see a removable USB C connection in the right spot on cheap mech keyboards, I've retrofitted one with a after market port and it was such a pain I said I would never bother again.For the price this is a pretty good keyboard, although one of the loudest I have, and I'm currently neck deep in about 15 different mech keyboards.  The switches are soldered on and are Jixian blues.  Reviews aren't great and I would agree. They feel fine but sound obnoxious.  I havn't tried the red switch option of this board but I would go that route if I ever repurchased, probably duller to the ear with similar feel when it comes to this grade switch.However, sound aside this is really nice to type on, and the cheapest 60% with USB C I have seen.  The keycaps it comes with are really nice doubleshots and it came with a bag of extras, even some that don't fit on this board, like number pad big 0 and long vertical enter.  Mine shipped all white and grey, and a bag of yellow modifiers/space/numkey/FN/backspace etc.  Also a red esc cap.I immediately took it apart by removing all keycaps and removing six screws.  Pretty solid board, but a big empty echo chamber of a base.  I added one layer of Zip-n-fit foam to the deep well towards the back, than another full panel layer to the remaining space.  I put 5 layers of masking tape on the back of the board and screwed it back together.This helped a long with the \"pinginess\" and reverb but the switches are still really load.  Replacing the switches will be my next project but a long on as there are 136 pins to solder.  Won't probably be worth it, but it's my wierd hobby and I will report back.My plans for this are my travel board for hotels.  I recently lost a very expensive keyboard in baggage check and would rather just have $25 loss over the aggravation and hassle over a $150 claim with the airlines.  If I was traveling with my wife though, she would tell me to throw this thing through the window because it is so loud.I guess if you are single, or plan to use it in a place with no one around, and budget is a concern and are willing to take it apart and make some adjustments, this is a very good $25 keyboard.  For anyone who has a great mechanical keyboard or are in earshot of 50ft of someone, this probably isn't for you.Edit: I bought another one with red switches.  I highly recommend going with red's, it feels better typing, and sounds 1000% better."

        "I work with my hands frequently and needed a set of tools to work with that was not too expensive. This set has proven it is worth getting and the quality of the tools are remarkable. There are more bits to choose from than I know what to do with. I work with electronic systems and need bits of all sizes and types, so these have been great for my daily use. Each tool has their own function and have found their way to being used for my job and even side projects. They are super easy to use and beginner friendly even.",
        "recently purchased the STREBITO 142-piece Precision Screwdriver Set to tackle various electronics repairs, and I have been thoroughly impressed. This set offers an incredible variety of 120 bits, perfect for working on everything from iPhones and laptops to game consoles like the PS4, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.Pros:Extensive Range of Bits: With 120 different bits, I’ve yet to encounter a repair where this kit didn’t have the right tool. It’s compatible with many different devices, including Apple products (with Pentalobe bits) and game controllers.Magnetic Design: The magnetic handle and bits make it easy to pick up and handle small screws without dropping them, which is a lifesaver for intricate jobs.Durable Materials: The bits are made from high-quality S2 steel, offering precision and durability over time, unlike cheaper kits that tend to wear down quickly.Additional Tools: Along with the screwdriver bits, the kit includes useful tools like tweezers, spudgers, and a suction cup, which have been great for safely opening devices without damage.Portable and Compact: The case is well-organized and compact, making it easy to take with me when I’m on the go for repairs.Cons:The sheer number of bits may be overwhelming for someone who only needs specific tools for occasional repairs. However, the variety ensures you’re prepared for almost any job.The organization of the case could be improved slightly to make it easier to find the right bit quickly.Overall, this is an excellent, comprehensive tool kit for any DIY electronics enthusiast or professional. Whether you’re repairing a laptop or swapping parts on a game console, the STREBITO kit has you covered. Highly recommended!",
        "I bought this screwdriver set with one main purpose, and secondarily just to have it around. It is amazing. The bit variety is all encompassing and the craftsmanship is genuinely shocking. Everything metal is sturdy and solid and the screwdriver handle is very nice with some weight and heft to it, not at all flimsy or toy-like as seen in the photos. The shank of the screwdriver extends via ball joints and the interior is a metal shaft to hold it, so it has weight and rigidity. I can't speak for the plastic spudgers (pry bars and guitar picks) or anything because I hate using them and find that they usually just break when I buy other sets. I might use them, might not. The metal pry bar/spudger is my favorite part besides the driver; very strong and well built. The carrying case is also very well built, I compare the nylon used to my name brand tool belt.Some reviews mention that the bits are flimsy and soft. The bits that come with this set are VERY TINY at the tips because these are technician drivers for electronics. They will not stand up to any sort of torque because of their size. That's just common sense. Treat your tool right and use the right tool for the job. After using the driver to take apart an 8bitdo controller I saw no damage at all on the bit itself and the screws seemed fine as well. I'm not saying there's no chance people got a bad batch but I am most certainly saying to take anyone saying their bits bent with a grain of salt, especially if their review mentions \"using force\" on it. These aren't made to break bolts.In short: be careful with these tools. Treat them right. They aren't adamantium and the screwdriver handle is really beefy, giving you the ability to put a lot of torque on the bits which can easily result in damage. This isn't baby's first toolkit. Right size, right torque, the tool will do the work for you. This set punches well above its weight for the price too so it's 100% worth grabbing even if you only need a few bits out of it right now. You'll get your money worth in the long run."

        "When this was ordered, my expectations were low based on the price of this, but I was prepared for that.When It arrived, I was shocked at the build quality of the seat. Flawless stitching, nice firm feaux leather, super solid and comfortable. If someone had the seat alone for sale, I would say it is on par with something more like $300 for just the seat. If I spent $300 on a seat, just a seat, and it looked and felt like this one, I would have never looked back, its that good. The frame is simple and easy to build, will require lots of tightening and micro adjustments, but once that is flushed out you are set. Barely flexes while I drive, in fact only the steering mount has any movement. The gear shifter is probably the only mount you may need to jerry-rig or adapt to get it honed in as far as the position, as it does not adjust. Again, insane quality. 10/10",
        "This is by far the best cockpit for the money that you can buy they do have another cockpit but they don't seem to advertise it very often you got to go to their website and then find it through there but anyhow this is a great beginner cockpit I'm a beginner an it's well made it was easy to assemble .I was missing apart but I talked to the people up there and you know the company took care of me and sent me it back I appreciate it thanks guys great work Chris",
        "Title: Easy to Assemble, Comfortable, Well-Built Racing Cockpit with a Minor QuirkRating: 4 out of 5 starsOverall, I'm very pleased with this racing cockpit. It was easy to assemble, is comfortable to use, and appears to be well-built. The only minor issue I encountered was that the bolts needed to be re-tightened after the first use.Ease of AssemblyThe instructions were clear and easy to follow. I was able to assemble the cockpit in about 30 minutes by myself. The parts all fit together well, and there were no missing or damaged pieces.ComfortThe cockpit is comfortable to sit in for extended periods of time. My buddies and I did a 2.4 hours Le Mans, and I was not fatigued at all. The seat is well-padded and supportive, and the backrest is adjustable. The pedals are also comfortable to use, and there's plenty of space for your legs.DurabilityThe cockpit appears to be well-built. The frame is made of sturdy metal, and the seat and pedals are made of high-quality materials. I'm confident that this cockpit will last for many years of use.Minor QuirkAfter the first use, I noticed that the bolts on the cockpit had loosened slightly. I had to re-tighten them all to prevent the cockpit from wobbling. This was a minor inconvenience, but it's something to be aware of.I do wish that there was some better cable management for my wheel and pedals. Overall not a huge issue though.OverallDespite this minor quirk, I'm still very happy with this racing cockpit. It's a great value for the price, and it's perfect for anyone who wants to enjoy racing games at home.I would highly recommend this cockpit to anyone looking for an affordable, comfortable, and well-built racing cockpit."

        "Easy to install, looks and feels very durable and it just looks awesome! My son loves it!",
        "Honestly I don't get why some of the reviews say what they do... This was easy to build, and fairly easy to put up. I did put my shelf on studs though, the shelf is spaced out 32 inches exactly far enough to place on 2 studs (typically 16 inches apart). Thing is sturdy and not going anywhere, didn't make but the 4 holes required to mount it, used a drill to get it right in there. Just follow the instructions!I'm very happy with this purchase it's exactly what I was looking for to place my Funkos on. I even used some filler boxes to show how many can fit. The lighting is just bonus!"

        "This is one of the highest quality items I’ve ever bought on Amazon. It’s built very, very well. The keys are mechanical , sturdy , and not cheap.  The display is slick. The display is hard to explain you have to see it in person, as I honestly found it to be different and better than I saw in photos.  Even the app is well made and maintained well .  It’s truly a lot of fun. Speakers are decent for its size. It’s not stereo, but it’s good. Connectivity is great with Bluetooth and an iPhone. I haven’t played around with the SD card or other options. It comes with some games and interesting apps. For example a color by number app. I really like the way their phone app works. It has so many tools for designing your LED drawings.. you can even import a photo and  have it attempt to make a display out of it. I attached one of these made from a photo of my dog.. not the best but I’m sure if I tried harder to crop and get a clean background it would be better.  The only thing a little off was the temperature reading.. in my area today it was 72 degrees. It insisted it was 62 . It lets you pick any city or town, and they also reported 62.. then suddenly it said 71, then 62 again. But whatever that’s such a minor detail. Probably the remote site it’s pulling from.  Everything else is great.",

        "I know my headline is kinda crazy sounding (and a little AI-ish,) but I AM a real (very excited) person, and I'm SO thrilled with this little hotkey pad. XD I just wanted to put answers to questions I couldn't find answers to in my headline, just in case it's helpful to others lol! I've also tried to leave a comprehensive but concise thoughts on my experience with the keypad for any fellow visual artists (especially those using larger-scale drawing tablets)WHY I NEEDED ITI currently use a WACOM Cintiq 22\" (without \"touch\" capabilities), and trying to access my hot keys on my desktop keyboard was a nightmare. It made it uncomfortable, and deterred me from drawing.I found this little guy with a lot of great reviews, and had also heard enough positive buzz about Huion over the years that I gave it a try.It took a while to arrive, so just be ready for a wait. However, once it DID arrive, it has blown all of my hopes and expectations out of the water.FIRST IMPRESSIONS- Battery was already 90% charged- Downloading the driver was very easy and fast- Setting up the hot keys was incredibly easy and flexible- It comes with 2 sets of sticker labels so you can keep track of your hot keys- It has nice little rubber grips on the bottom so it doesn't slide all over the screen- It comes with a nice 3-ish foot USB cable so you don't HAVE to use bluetooth if you don't have it. I also think the cable is long enough that it doesn't get TOO in the way when you're drawing, either.MY FAV ASPECTS (So Far)1. I LOVE that the dial lets you set THREE different hot key settings simultaneously. I currently use \"zoom in/out\" and \"canvas rotate\". All you have to do is click the little button in the middle of the dial to switch between your desired \"hot key mode\". It's beyond convenient and comfortable for my hand.2. Super big fan of the bluetooth and wire connect options, and how the wire is long enough that it wont really impede your ability to draw or strain the connection.3. It's very light, and comfortable to use. While it has nice rubber grips, they aren't \"too much\" so you're not smudging your screen, but as long as your hand is on the device, it isn't sliding everywhere, either.4. Set up was incredibly straightforward and easy, and I loved how it offered program-specific key menus (like Clip Studio Paint and Photoshop).FINAL THOUGHTSI know it's just a hot key pad, but it has totally changed my workflow, and I'm much more excited and motivated to draw because I'm way more comfortable and efficient.I'm really impressed with the extra details like the stickers and USB cable that improve the user experience. I'm also really impressed that it functions SO seamlessly with my Wacom. A part of me had really worried that it WOULDN'T work so great since HUION sells their OWN line of drawing tablets--but it's working great.I've only been using it for a few days, so if it suddenly stops working or something, I'll update my review then. But, for fellow visual artists looking for a simple but effective hot key pad to make work more comfortable and efficient, I am REALLY pleased with the purchase, and highly recommend. ^_^",
        "Slight Update: This can't function while charging. Of course, wireless is more convenient, but if I'm running out of juice, I'd expect it to still work wired. Nope. Not a dealbreaker, but an inconvenience.*original review*I'd been using the older version of this from XP-Pen (AC19) for a few years and used it daily. I'm not an artist, but I love using a macro pad for productivity purposes. Unfortunately, two of the keys started dying, so I weighed my options between the newer model from XP-Pen and this one from Huion. I figured the extra buttons would be good, so I got this one.Everything is plastic, but it feels durable enough. I expected the buttons to be rubbery, but they're just flat plastic. No complaint, but just different than I thought. Bluetooth paired easily and I haven't had any issues with is reconnecting. I personally with it had a 2.4Ghz receiver, but that's more just personal preference.The software works perfectly well. Personally I like to use some longer text strings as shortcuts and this couldn't handle that. Instead I had to use a key binding with Auto Hotkey to do what I wanted. It worked for me, but is an extra step.The scroll wheel has been working as expected. Personally, I with it didn't poke out as far as it does, but I generally just use one finger on top, not fingers on either side, so I can't fault it for a difference of opinion.The only actual complain I have is with the included stickers. They're great if you plan to use the default functions in art programs, but I expected extras printed to give me more options. There are a few blank ones, but what's the point of blank black stickers? The keys are already black, and I can't write anything on them. They should have at least provided some blank white stickers so I could write or draw my own shortcut reminder on them. I might try to get other stickers or experiment with regular paper and hodge-podge.All in all, I'd definitely recommend it (at least when it's on sale for $40). There aren't enough options out there, but this is a good option.",

        "The Bluetooth adapter works well. It was a little difficult to set up, because the quick start guide isn’t as accurate as I would hope. To get this mic to work right you have to adjust the party sounds settings when your actually in a party with friends under the party settings (not main system settings). The directions don’t specify this. Also I do wish it was a little more comfortable in/on your ear. After 2-3 hours I need to switch ears.But this mic is well worth the buy. It is so nice not to be wired to your controller. I can walk around and still chat while leaving the controller on the table.  Sound quality is also good. And my friends say I sound fine.Battery life is good.  I played for 6-7 hours straight one session with no signs of low battery.Connection is simple just plug the base in to the controller and turn on the Bluetooth headset and it connects right away.  You can even connect it to your phone if you want. I believe you can be connected to your phone and game at the same time for seamless switching if you get a call while gaming.Over all this is a good headset and I’m glad I have it.",
        "Pros: absolutely none. There's nothing good to say about this product.Cons: everything. I set this headset up for chat which was the intended use case. Once setup it seemed good in a chat test other than the other person could hear an echo and once in game I couldn't get the chat to work properly no matter what settings I used. The other players voices would queue up the microphone, my voice wouldn't trigger the microphone, ambient sounds would trigger the microphone, and in the end of I was able to get it setup so I could talk everyone heard a massive echo and reverb.Final thoughts are Turtle Beach should make a public apology for ever releasing this and pull it from the shelves. Do not buy this piece of junk if you are looking for a quality headset, maybe I received a bad one but there are a lot of bad reviews for this to be a random issue.",

        "Here is what I did to setup the device for use with my Xbox Elite Series 2 controller.- Ensured the xbox controller was fully updated via the Xbox accessories app on the Xbox.- Turned the controller off.- Plugged in the chatpad until it made a good solid connection. (It does not click into place)- Plugged the 2.4GHz receiver into the Xbox.- Turned on the controller (the chatpad lit up solid green) and immediately pressed the sync button on the chatpad.- Tested the chatpad in game and it is working perfectly.----------------------------------------Now, onto the functionality in game.This chatpad is a literal USB keyboard. I bought this because I started playing Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV). My hope was that this chatpad could act as extra inputs for regular hotbars alongside the controller cross-bars. I disabled the direct chat setting in-game and setup a hotbar on-screen. I then setup the keybinds on the chatpad that I wanted for the hotbar. Finally, I added the actions I wanted by using the virtual mouse to drag the actions to the hotbar. It works perfectly! I now have all the general actions I need set to the hotbar and bound to the chatpad. Meanwhile all my crossbars are setup for combat. It also still has the regular keybinds for keyboard, this allows me to still quickly use the chatpad for chat by pressing enter on the chatpad and typing out my message.---------------------------------------The negatives.- The chatpad construction feels sturdy but while inserted into the controller it does have a slight flex if you press with a decent amount of force on the sides of the chatpad. As long as you don't slam down on the chatpad with a ton of force it should be ok.- It is going to decrease the battery life of the controller but not by much. The chatpad draws 40mA while the keyboard is lit but the backlight turns off after 6 seconds of no use. It also draws an extra 0.8mA when a button is pressed. Not enough to worry about for me.- The button inputs are momentary. You can't walk around continuously while using WASD input. That may be an issue for some users who want that.Overall, these negatives are not enough to be an issue to me. For some these may be dealbreakers.--------------------------------------This chatpad is amazing for the price. I can see myself using it for a long time. I will update this review if I have any issues with it or if it stops working.",

        "The keyboard works with my standard Xbox Series X controller. I tested and confirmed that it works with both the store search function, and text chat on The Elder Scrolls Online. The light up feature is nice, but I did find a couple of issues: I have had the keyboard stop working if I pressed the space bar in too hard, which was fixed by pressing on the bottom of the device to reestablish the connection. The keyboard also effects the ergonomics of the Xbox controller, and I found that my ring and pinky fingers were not able to wrap around the handles like normal. This could be a bit distracting, but fortunately, it is easy enough to remove the keyboard if you don't plan to use it for some time. Also, the audio jack is on a hinge, and it folds back into the device. So if you don't plan on using voice chat through the controller, you can leave it folded. I have my Xbox set to play all noise through a connected controller device, so when I installed the keyboard with the audio jack, all my sound disappeared, folding the jack back into the device solved this, and it is a nice option without having to change your system settings. Overall, I think having the keyboard is better than not, and I do find that it makes my typing twice as fast."

        "The first one worked so well I ordered another for my second desk. Super easy to setup, no screwing into the desk and creates a nice clean look.",
        "This was by far one of the best items I purchased online from Amazon. It was simple to setup without any screwing into my desk. I purchased two just in case as I have a ton of wires. I used two but one would have been fine. It was strong and sturdy and held the power adaptors and all cords. Plus it comes with some wire managment pieces for the desk and velcro to tie wires together. Highly Recommend.",
        "This works great to have the cords under your desk instead of on top. Although, you can’t adjust the height of it, so that’s a bummer. I hangs lower than I’d like it to, but it works. I was able to fit my Anker Power Strip Surge Protector in it (12 outlets w/USB A & C ports) as well a couple monitor ps blocks. It’s not the prettiest in the basket, but it beats having all that mess on the desk behind my monitors.Value for your money, checkEasy to assemble, checkDurable & holds enough weightI give it a 4/5 since you cannot adjust the height. Other than that, it’s a great buy."

        "Backstory, I was looking for a new gaming headset, and I went with the very highly reviewed hyperx cloud alpha S, and hated it.  I decided to try this one out because I’ve always enjoyed razer products, even if there are a few bad reviews.This headset blows the HyperX out of the water. Better sound, way better comfort, clearer mic, and the hyper sense haptic thing is game changing.Pros:-excellent sound quality-Very comfortable. Ear cups don’t press on jaw like the HyperX, padding is thicker and more resilient feeling.-Noise cancelling is just right. Little things don’t break immersion, but if someone falls down the stairs or the house catches fire, you’ll hear it.-mic is very clear. The synapse tests and peer reviews tell me this is the clearest mic I’ve used, plus it has separate adjustable thresholds for volume, background noise filtering, and voice clarification-Hyper Sense Haptics…. I think this was mostly for People playing FPS games, makes gunfire and such “feel” more real, but as someone who always has Spotify up while gaming, I Love the simulated base this adds in on low/medium settings.  You could never get base like that from speakers that strap to your head, but the haptics can emulate having a nice sub nearby. Very nice touch.-RGB is a tasteful accent, not garish. I also like that I can set which colors I want in my spectrum for various patterns. Setting this to just the shades of blue and green is very nice, and matches the Corsair RGB on my desk/towerCons:-No mute light on mic. This is a nice feature most brands have and I’ve gotten used to. Nice visible indicator that I have my mic muted to prevent embarrassing over sharing.-Thx surround feature sounds bad. I’m sure it’s great for FPS players that are willing to sacrifice sound quality to have better directional sense, but I’m not a FPS player so it’s not worth the drop in quality. This one isn’t really a detriment, it’s just a feature I don’t use. Sound quality with THX left off is phenomenal.Overall I’m super excited about this one. This is the best headset I’ve had in my 15+ years of gaming headset usage. Highly recommended.",
        "I recently picked up the Razer Kraken V3 X Wired USB Gaming Headset, and I couldn't be happier with my choice! From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek design and comfortable fit caught my eye. The lightweight construction makes it easy to wear for long gaming sessions without any discomfort.The audio quality is phenomenal—crystal-clear sound that immerses you in the game. Whether I'm listening to subtle in-game details or enjoying my favorite music, everything sounds rich and vibrant. The customizable RGB lighting is a nice touch, adding a bit of flair to my gaming setup.The microphone quality is impressive as well, with clear voice capture and minimal background noise. It’s perfect for in-game chat and streaming. Plus, the controls are easily accessible, allowing me to adjust the volume or mute the mic on the fly.Overall, the Razer Kraken V3 X is a fantastic headset that delivers on both performance and comfort. I highly recommend it to any gamer looking to enhance their audio experience!",
        "These headphones are really good and the mic sounds so amazing, the design is so cool and it’s really not heavy, it’s really worth the money!"

        "I have small hands, 6.5 inches from palm to middle finger tip and ring sizes 4.5-6. I'm able to use this but I did need to shift my hand position to the right so I could use the thumb buttons. I swaped the directional keys to correspond and added some textured gaming keycap stickers to help me learn the new keybinds. I am able to use all of the buttons easily except the top row which requires a little stretch to reach but that's fine with me, I just make those the seldom used keybinds. I needed more pinky modifier buttons as well as thumb accessible modifier buttons (the D-pad is perfect for that). I use this for gaming along with a G600 mouse, it works wonderfully and solved the problem I was having with needing more modifiers and being able to hit binds faster/more reliably. You can record double modifiers with this such as Alt+Shift, I needed that feature specifically. It looks amazing matching my mercury huntsman mini and I love having a separate keypad for gaming rather than using my keyboard. It allows me to have crazy re-mapped keybinds without losing the ability to type normally. I use W A,S D,Q, and E; all the rest of the keys are re-mapped to numpad or modifiers. The space bar key (20) is a bit low and the distance makes it unreliable for me to use quickly so its in the seldom used keybind category. I re-mapped the circular button above the D-pad to map, the D-pad is space bar and 3 modifiers. The little D-pad thumbstick attachment is really great, too!<>- 6 month update-I absolutely love this thing.  I've adjusted to using it all the time for gaming and it is so incredibly comfortable. The wrist rest is my favorite part in regards to comfort and the hand positioning in general is relaxing, the shorter keycaps help with this. I found some better gripy texture tape for my most used keys. The joy stick for the D-pad has become pivitol for my gameplay. I love this thing so much that I got a second one for couch gaming. Synapse 3 doesn't support 2 of the same device running at once so I had to get a USB splitter. I purchased both devices \"Used like new\" and they have been wonderful. Both arrived in perfect condition with no blemishes or malfunction.- 6 mo th update on the second I purchased in \"Like New\" Condition.  One of the keys broke out of nowhere while I was using it. The device had not been damaged while in my care. Razer does not sell replacement keys for this item and refuses to provide them. Keys are not covered in the warranty, so if they break you are out of luck. However, I was able to find these keys on Amazon that replace the low profile Taryarus keys perfectly -lamd they are very affordable -X-keys Keycap Cherry MX Compatible",
        "I cannot put into words how unbelievably incredibly this product is. I legit want to be Razor's new spokesperson after what this thing has gone through and it still works perfectly. Let me explain for those who are wondering if this product is worth buying:I've owned this product for over 2 years now and it has changed my gaming experienced in ways that only divine intervention could achieve. A couple months ago, I was playing a game and was really in the mood for some egg nog, given the holiday spirit. I poured a red Solo cups full of nog (which is 16 oz of egg nog, by the way), walked it from my kitchen to my room, tripped over my dog as I entered my bedroom, and proceeded to spill every drop of the nog directly into the keys of my Razor gamepad. I thought my $2,500 computer would explode, but instead, nothing happened.I quickly unplugged my Razor, ran to the kitchen, turned the sink on full blast, and drenched this glorious contraption in water. I know you're not supposed to submerge electronic products, but it was either the water, or the thick, sugary, sticky, goopy egg nog, and I chose water. I rinsed it out for about 20 minutes and then shook the water out into a towel. I realized there was probably still some drops of water inside and didn't want to plug it back in and test it while it was still wet.So I set up a table in front of a space heater and decided to leave it there for 10 or 15 minutes. When I returned, HALF OF THE RAZER WAS MELTED ABD WARPED BY THE SPACE HEATER. Apparently the heater was on high and I set the Razer too close to it. At this point, I start going through all the stages of grief. I'm angry, crying, laughing, depressed, bartering with God Himself, and eventually just accept the fact that I will have to buy a new baby.I spend the next 24 hours wallowing in sorrow as I lost the only true love of my life. The next day I plug in my warped, twisted, previously egg nog filled Razer, and by the grace of God Almighty, it powers on. The buttons click perfectly, everything is responsive, nothing is wrong whatsoever. It has been two months since that incident and I have not encountered a single issue. And I game A LOT. This beautiful piece of hand crafted machinery is the greatest purchase I have ever made.Now, onto the other reasons you won't regret buying this incredible gamepad:1. Unbelievably comfortable.2. You'll never have to change in-game controlls, you simply change your own controls on the gamepad (which means you can leave your game control settings as default).3. Looks stunning in your desk. The lights are so much fun to play around with infinite possibilities.4. Built like a tank (as discussed above).5. Macros are a breeze to set up. Just make sure the game you're playing allows macros and won't ban you for using them.6. The Razer synapse (the program you use to set everything up) is intuitive and constantly expanding.7. Easily portable and can take to friend's houses to make their set up feel like your own.This product is an 11/10 and I would recommend it to literally anybody and everybody.",
        "My Orbweaver finally gave up the ghost forcing me to use my Tartarus Pro.  Luckily, this coincided with the new Synapse software release.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised at the changes.  My thumbpad now works correctly as an 8 way control and the macro programming has been made much easier and more intuitive. They've added a macro search option (essential when you've built as many macros as I have) which is very handy.  The only glitch I've seen so far is trying to program the \\ into a macro.  It does not recognize the keystroke and defaults to a 3 keyboard command...very strange, but not a deal breaker. Original review is belowI purchased the Tartarus Pro to replace my Orbweaver.  The Orbweaver was starting to have key failures after several years of faithful service.  Programming the Orbweaver was pretty straightforward and easy.  I'd created hundreds of macros for numerous games over the years.When I started to delve into the Tartpro, I hit wall after wall with the new software.  Movement with the thumbpad went from simple to not working in 8 directions unless I emulated an analog joystick.  Getting macros to bind to keystrokes was an exercise in frustration.  It would show the correct macro yet execute the default original keystroke.  For single keystroke macros I could get it to repeat while the key was depressed.  For multikey inputs it would only execute the macro once no matter how many times I tried to make it work.For now, I'm still using the Orbweaver until it totally fails.  I'll keep looking for videos and guides on the Tartpro...if I have a eureka moment I'll come back and modify my review.  This should not be this difficult in comparison to the original programming software."

        "I recently purchased an external CD drive with multiple inputs, and I couldn't be happier with it! As many laptops no longer come with built-in CD drives, this product is a fantastic solution, especially for those of us who still have CDs and DVDs we need to access.This drive is not only versatile with its multiple input options, but it also comes in a sleek carrying case, making it incredibly portable and easy to store. The setup was simple, and it worked perfectly right out of the box. Whether I’m burning CDs, installing software, or just enjoying some old-school media, this drive handles everything with ease.For the price, it's an absolute steal - $30 cheaper than the 1 option being sold at at my local Staples store. The build quality is excellent, and the performance is reliable—it's  a good product at this price point. If you’re looking for an external CD drive this is definitely the one to get! Highly recommended!",
        "I bought the CD player so I could review some of my X-rays I got from the hospital. It worked great. I attached the USB in to my Mac and once it read the CD it popped up on the screen.It’s small and comes in a cute bag. It’s not very heavy at all. It is a pretty loud when it’s trying to read the disc like loud airflow and spinning of the cd but I think that’s pretty normal in cd players.Overall solid",
        "This is a good compact device that is easy to use and serves its purpose well.  I had an issue connecting the device to my PC, but the manufacturer customer support was top-notch and they helped me resolve my problem quickly and efficiently.  My only complaint about this DVD/CD Burner is that the two cables that are included are both extremely short!  Unless you are planning on putting this unit right next to your computer and there is a power outlet right behind your machine, you will probably need extensions!  Overall a pretty good buy for the price though."

        "This USB hub has been an absolute lifesaver for my workspace! As someone who juggles multiple devices and gadgets daily, this hub is exactly what I needed to keep everything powered, organized, and running efficiently.Why I Love It:Plenty of Ports: With so many USB ports, I never run out of space for charging or connecting my devices. From external hard drives and keyboards to phones and tablets, it handles everything I throw at it.Individual Switches: The individual on/off switches for each port are a standout feature. They make it easy to control power to specific devices without unplugging them, which is a huge convenience when managing multiple items.Fast Charging and Data Transfer: The charging speed is fantastic, and data transfers are quick and seamless. I’ve used it with high-capacity external drives, and there’s no lag or delay.Durable and Well-Made: The construction feels solid, and it stays in place on my desk without sliding around. The power adapter ensures there’s no loss of power, even with multiple high-demand devices connected.What Could Be Better:The hub is a bit larger than I expected, so it takes up some space on my desk. However, it’s slim enough to tuck neatly into a corner, so it’s not a dealbreaker.Overall, this USB hub is a fantastic addition to any workspace. It’s reliable, versatile, and makes managing multiple devices a breeze. If you’re tired of constantly switching out cables or running out of USB ports, this is the perfect solution. Highly recommend—five stars!",
        "This is great. Gives me plenty of space for multiple USB's and devices. The SD and MicroSD slots are great because I don't need an adapter. Design is sleek. It doesn't get too hot. Speeds are pretty much limited to the USB read and write speeds. The LED's can be a bit too bright but I can't complain much about that. I do wish it had USB-C slots but that's about the only thing. It works very well.",
        "It is just what it claims to be.  I have multiple wireless devices routed through this hub without any issues including high dpi mouse, Keyboard (2.4G dongle), PC gaming controller, Streaming Microphone (HyperX) and more. The only thing that I have had to do is turn the power off and on again to reset the Microphone.  The Hub has a Charging port but to be honest it is very slow, but works well to charge accessories overnight when the PC is shut down.  No complains, and will more than likely order a few more for other computers around the house and office."

        "I have a lot of things to say about this incredible piece of equipment, but here's a TLDR for people who want a quick glance at multiple reviews: it's one of the cheapest flight control sets you can find on the market that still delivers high quality performance to any game you choose, however it must be noted that the controls can easily move around if you push or pull too hard and that right-handed people will naturally feel better with the controls.Now, let's start with all of the negatives just so everyone is aware.  1. Firstly, the material that the set is composed of is relatively cheap plastic. This doesn't detract from the feel of it (at least in my opinion), as the handles have nice grips to assist you (the yoke actually has a rubber siding for your comfort, which I love). Because of this, it's not exactly the heaviest thing in the world, so you can imagine what it might be like jumping into an FA-18 Super Hornet and absolutely sending it into a steep turn. If you can't, I'll put it this way: the controls will fly, not you. They don't fall off the table, but they may raise up a little bit and disorient you. Also, the rudder pedals function the same way. Make sure you are not pushing or pulling down on them too hard or they will end up moving (and in my case that's bad because I have a foot-rest bar from one end of the bottom of my desk to the other, and you can put two and two together). Wear shoes when you're using the rudders for maximum comfort and performance. A solution to this entire problem could be to buy some clamps for the desk and floor, but I have yet to do that since the issue isn't big enough for me to throw away more money.  2. The throttle and yoke combo is made for right-handed people, so if you are left-handed like me, be mindful that holding the controls the way you'd prefer may not feel exceptional. That in no way means it isn't comfortable, however my hands begin to ache a tiny bit after long hours of gameplay because of the unnatural angle they're positioned at. This only happens after extremely long sessions, though, and all things considered, holding the controls still feels nice the wrong way. If you easily get carpal tunnel or other hand aches, be mindful of this, please.  3. Last but not least, make sure you are wary of the fact that if you're in a game and need to use your mouse for something, the controls may disconnect and require that you press a button to recalibrate them. This sometimes puts me into an immediately steep climb in Microsoft Flight Simulator and thus either a stall or an annoying gain in altitude. This issue can be avoided by retaining the position your controls were in when you paused, however, if that doesn't work, be prepared to immediately readjust your controls.Now it's time to explain how much butt this thing kicks.  1. The controls are SUPER realistic. The throttle, yoke, and rudder pedals make you feel like you are genuinely in control of a full-blown aircraft. Not much else to say on that.  2. There are tons of buttons to suit your needs. The yoke has multiple buttons on its top, and a plethora of buttons on its base. The throttle has numerous, quirky-looking buttons behind the throttle itself. While the rudder pedals don't have buttons, they don't need any. That wouldn't make much sense. The brakes and movement capabilities of them are super intricate!  3. The controls are incredibly easy to set up, but make sure you have enough USB slots. I did not, so I purchased a dongle with four USB ports so that I could connect everything at once and make my setup literally plug-and-play. Note, however, that the rudder has a specific, ethernet-looking cord that you may not have a slot for in your computer. I believe it can connect to the throttle, but I haven't seen the slot for it so don't quote me on that. I went ahead and purchased an adapter for the rudder pedals so that everything was able to go into a USB port. It's a little extra money that you might not want to spend, but I chose convenience over price and I do not regret it in the slightest.  4. For the last major plus side to this set, it feels comfortable. I'm a left-handed person, and you already know this thing is right-handed, so there is a little bit of a discrepancy in my review. However, nothing can take away from how comfortable the set feels when you're in the cockpit of an aircraft. The yoke is made extremely well for how cheap it probably is, the throttle allows your hand to rest nicely while flying, and the rudder pedals are sturdy, meaning they won't move around unless you push a little hard (it's also harder to rudder in the air, but be careful so as to not accidentally press them mid-air, or your aircraft may do things it was never meant to do.I'm so pleased with this set, and it was one of my bigger purchases for my own entertainment. So far, nothing has genuinely let me down. A few nitpicks here and there, but that is almost completely overshadowed once you actually get into the air. There's so much more I could say that I loved about the controls, but that would make my review applicable for a Harvard essay. I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in playing an aviation-based game because of its affordability and feel. Hope you found this review helpful. Throttle on!",
        "I just wanted to leave a review for this as there currently aren't very many. This is part review for this stick, and part comparison of it between other sticks. For reference, I've extensively used the following sticks: Saitek X52 and X52 pro, Logitech 3D Extreme Pro, old FCS, Warthog, and now this. Also, I play pretty much every type of flight game, including DCS, IL-2 back in the day, SWG back in the day, E:D, and SC.So with that out of the way, this is my favorite stick. It feels weird to say that when I own a warthog, and the build quality and general feel is definitely better on the warthog. The button layout is also much better on the hog. However, once you factor in the price difference and the twist axis, this stick is my daily driver. Another big advantage this stick has over the hog, to me, is the lighter springs. The hog is great for flying an old warplane or something that's really slow, but not so great when dogfighting in a space sim, or when needing to do really precise movements. I just overall find this stick to be easier to use for space sims in general.The new model doesn't seem like a massive upgrade from the old one. I'm not sure what's up with the orange coloring, but I digress. The main difference is that the buttons on the base now have textured markings (which is a life saver in VR or if you just don't want to be looking down), most of the buttons now are textured and more ergonomical, and it seems that the spring makes a lot less noise and is of slightly higher quality. Although that could just be because it's new and my old FCS is old. One thing to note, expanding on textured buttons, is that if you are playing in VR, the warthog throttle is actually a pretty terrible experience. The switches are all over the place and you won't have any way to see them. I hope that all sticks in the future follow the trend of having unique textures on the buttons, so you can feel your way around what you're doing. Definitely a major plus if you're playing in VR.If you're new to Thrustmaster in general, another thing to note is that the T.A.R.G.E.T. scripting software is second to none as far as allowing you to get really in depth with customizing how you want your stick to act, as well as how it's programmed. It's not exactly user-friendly, but you can do pretty much anything you want with it.This stick's biggest weakness is the lack of buttons on the handle. There are plenty on the base, but I really find myself just wanting more on the handle. I picked up two of the cougar MFD's, and find those easier to use than the buttons on the base. Still, next time around, get some more buttons on this thing's handle Thrustmaster. I really wish that this stick and the warthog could make a baby. I'd love to have the metal sticks with the great button layouts, while also having the ability to use it ambidextrously, having a twist axis, and having the lightweight handling that this one does. Unfortunately, that's not really an option. So given that, this stick is my recommendation. The warthog is technically superior, but this stick offers more than enough bang for the buck, and I'm actually probably going to sell my hog soon since it doesn't have a twist axis. The extra handle buttons on the hog are really nice, but the lack of a twist axis just makes it almost useless in a space sim. And you can make up for a lack of buttons with VoiceAttack.The bottom line is that whether you're a new pilot or a seasoned veteran, this stick can do it all pretty well. I've been flying in PC games since I was a kid, and I've used a lot of sticks. This one is my favorite. I think you'd be hard pressed to prove that a warthog is going to give any real-world combat advantage, so the only reason I see to fork over the extra cash is if you really want that metal handle (which does feel nice...).My current setup is using two of these, two MFD's, and a throttle on my left side. I have rudder pedals, but I have no need for them with this setup. The two sticks provide full 6DOF freedom in space sims, and the throttle still allows me to fly regular planes (or long haul flights in space sims) without awkwardly trying to use two sticks. Then the MFD's fill the need for a near infinite amount of buttons. You can slap all of that on a board with some velcro, sit in an office chair, and rival the setups of the biggest and baddest simpits out there for less than what you'd pay for just a warthog stick in some places. Just buy two of these and you won't regret it, seriously.That's my .02, hopefully it helps someone. Happy flying, o7",
        "Set works well together and well supported in games. Lots of buttons, conveniently located.  Love the buttons on the throttle.  But the throttle control has significant “stiction” that makes fine throttle adjustments jerky and frankly impossible. I retrofitted an aftermarket slider replacement found on Etsy for a massively improved experience. (Look for CoreHawk if you want to consider this).  With that change, I love the playability of this. TM SHOULD have made the throttle this playable out of the box, though!"

        "TLDR: The Fifine AM8 is a fantastic budget competitor to much higher-end mics like the Shure SM7B, while still maintaining aesthetics and quality, but that does come with a few quirks, as expected of the less expensive option.I found out about Fifine through a review of the A8 while looking for a more value-oriented, but still highly performant mic, and although I was impressed with the A8's sound quality, it is a compressor mic, and I quickly realized there is a reason professionals tend to stick closely to dynamic's. Thus, after finding that the same brand had released this mic, a similarly priced, value-oriented dynamic mic that supports XLR, comes with an arm, and can even trade blows with the infamous Shure SM7B ( as seen in video titles like \"DO NOT Waste Your Money on The Shure SM7B\" on Youtube), I didn't take long at all to place an order.Upon opening the box, I was not disappointed with the aesthetics, as, despite its plastic construction and RGB, it maintains a professional look, and feels solid and hefty in the hand and the stand likewise does not appear flimsy despite its low price. While setting it up, the stand does show its price a bit with its thin, hollow construction, but alas, this is to be expected for the price, and although it is a little short, after set up I have rarely had to think about the stand at all, a sign that it is indeed doing its job perfectly well. The mic, on the other hand, only raises expectations further during setup, with the well-diffused back RGB showing off immediately upon being plugged in, and the capacitive buttons feeling very consistent and responsive. I was also very glad to see that the PC sound passthrough from the headset monitoring port required no setup, started automatically, and sounded indistinguishable from the built-in pc sound. I did however notice a few quirks with this set, such as tapping or hitting the desk sometimes reverberating through the stand and being audible through the mic, the on-mic features (buttons, dials, and RGB,) not functioning without USB C power (such as when using XLR), and the mic reverting to whichever connection method (USB or XLR) was connected first, with no button to switch between the two, and instead having to unplug and plug the mic back in to switch.The sound test was about as I expected from hearing the mic on Youtube, which is fantastic, as the mic does indeed prove itself to be impressively close to mics like the  Shure SM7B. With this level of sound quality, if you are, like me, looking for an endgame mic to use for anything from gaming, zoom calls, or even \"prosumer\" level work like content creation, I see no reason to look for any more than this mic, as the diminishing returns of higher-end mics are simply not worth it for personal use, and 99% of people would not be able to tell the difference between this mic and an actual professional mic (see previously mentioned youtube video). That being said, if audio is your main hobby, or if you would be using this mic professionally, then, and only then you have reason to look further.",
        "I have nothing but good things to say about this microphone. If you don't want to read a long review, the tl;dr: This is a great plug-n-play microphone that has great sound quality and a price that can't be beat.When the pandemic hit in 2020, I started playing online games with friends. When things went back to normal a few years later, we kept playing online as many of us had moved to different areas of the US.During that time, I used a nice set of bluetooth headphones and that was adequate. We mostly played strategy games, board games, or poker games where sound quality didn't matter.In 2024 we hopped on the Helldivers 2 train and the bluetooth headphones just weren't cutting it. To use the microphone with bluetooth, you have to accept the sound changes from full stereo to hands-free mono. For a game like Helldivers 2, that just didn't work. I couldn't hear anything at all.So I decided to invest in a microphone. I know nothing at all about microphones and just wanted something relatively cheap that would work. I did a little research and the main thing people said was to get a \"dynamic mic\" as opposed to a \"condenser mic\". Shocker, the dynamic mics are more expensive, often costing $100+.I ended up getting this Fifine, which was significantly cheaper. And to be honest, I wouldn't be able to tell it was a cheap model. The quality of this mic looks really good and feels solid. It uses USB-C which is nice, and even has an XLR jack for the serious audio people (I don't know anything about this -- I just use the USB jack).It is seriously plug-n-play. It took me all of 5 minutes to unbox and get set up at my desk. It just...works.The only additional recommendation I'd make. Even though this is supposed a \"dynamic mic\" which only picks up sounds right next to the mic, I found this still picked up all my keyboard strokes and could even pick up mouse clicking.The solution to this if you have an Nvidia card is Nvidia Broadcast. It is free and it has some sort of noise filtering that does an excellent job to remove background noise like what I mentioned above.If you need a stand and a mic and don't want to dive down the rabbit-hole of audio equipment, this is probably your best value-to-quality option. It's no nonsense, dead easy to set up, and in conjunction with noise filtering software like Nvidia Broadcast sounds phenomenal.",
        "The microphone is insane for its price and I recommend buying it. First, the microphone sounds insane, the sound is well-balanced and sounds great for the price. The boom arm is not too shabby either, it is well-made and very high quality. The design of the mic itself is very beautiful and eye-catching.  The RGB is milky and pops with color. The foam covering the mic blocks most of the spitting and annoying sounds in the background. The only thing I would improve is the cable, it is stiff. Besides that, the microphone has a lot of buttons allowing you to easily change the sound, RGB, and the eq of the mic.Overall if you want a budget high quality podcast microphone I recommend giving this one a shot!"

        "This is my first mixer and it's pretty good, but it makes me immediately want to upgrade to a better unit.The main issue is that through the XLR input the volume is a bit low. It's not terrible, but it will need to be raised in post. Also being able to record up to 4 samples and play them back is cool, but the quality is pretty bad even though that might make them funnier.The sliders on mine were dirty/dusty so when I would slide the headphones one down to 0% it would play at 100%. A little contact cleaner fixed it and it hasn't happened again, but that could potentially damage your ears.The RGB is nice and can be turned off, but the volume indicator bars that constantly flash stay on which can be annoying in a dark room.Overall it's good for the price, but maybe spend a little more and get something a bit more professional."

        "Love the keys. Love the brown switches. Love the keycaps even. They feel nice. Yes, it's edgy space font but it's not TOO bad. About a 2/10 on the HR Giger scale. Only one problem:WASD is dumb. Very very dumb. Why? I don't care that it's what the entire world uses. If you learn how to touch type, your left hand will naturally fall on the home key, F. That's why it has a little nub on it. So you can develop feel memory and just know your fingers are on the home keys. So why wouldn't you use ESDF instead? Then you get a pinky key too. A. WASD is stupid. Sorry.Anyhow, they put the first completely smooth F key on anything I've ever seen in my life. I had to throw it away. I had a few spares. It looks awesome with a proper F key that's a different color. I use F a lot. : ) So it's important that it's correct. Now I can find my movement keys by feel again. I don't have to waste time looking.Superglue, that's up to you. This is a personal preference. I put a little dab on the wrist rest to make it permanent. I loved it so much. I just put it on the magnets and let them be together forever. It's better that way.Otherwise, wow what a nice addition to a Star Citizen setup. This sits nicely off to the left of a VKB Omni-Throttle for quick accessible on-foot controls, or anything else. Opening up the mobiglass quick because you have a real F1 key. Etc. tapping escape to fix a keybind quick. Setting up a macro for Flight > ATC > VTOL. Makes the game that much better. Worth every penny.It gets a five for value. They are using good quality parts. They did put thought into the design. Like you can tell it was designed for your fingers to fall on F key home position based on where the space is placed. You literally have to stretch to hit it if you use wasd. ESDF? your hand just falls naturally on everything. So nice. The switches feel great. Love that soft bump in the press. You subconsciously start remembering where that bump happens and it improves your timing because it coincides with actuation. That's the benefit of browns for gaming. You aren't just mashing the key into the board for timing. You don't have to. So your keyboard takes less abuse. And you maintain a lower level of chill, so game better.Very comfortable. Perfect wrist rest. Perfect key position. Great key caps. Great lighting, Oh great lighting options. They offer five. For me it was like, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, OH!. The fifth one I liked a lot. It's a blue and green burst gradient. Very awesome looking. Matches my stuff.The only other thing to maybe complain about is it slides around a little. Like the bottom isn't grippy enough. Easily fixed with two pieces of VHB tape on the bottom but worth mentioning.I am one very happy customer.",

        "There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!1) Daily useNot everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros: - Fits incredibly well around your hand - Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use  > Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc. - Great grip - Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software2) GamingWhen I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros: - You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better! - The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something) - The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!*** Update ***The mouse is durable  and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself.",
        "I had originally purchased the logitech G502 X wired mouse as it's supposed to be an updated version of the G502 HERO. I was not impressed with G502 X. All the supposed upgrades from the G502 HERO were a let down. The G502 HERO is much better in every way. The side buttons are positioned correctly. The additional 2 top buttons on the left main button are minimal and well placed. I prefer a solid mouse with some heft to it, out of the box the build quality feels great and the additional weights are nice to have.In comparison the G502 X felt cheap, and was too light for my tastes. The side buttons were moved too far back making it awkward to hit the back button. The size of the 2 additional top buttons on the main left button were increased, which made it very easy to accidentally press them while gaming.If you are comparing the two mice I hope this helps. There is a reason why the G502 HERO has as many reviews as it does.",
        "This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."

        "This keyboard is designed primarily for gaming, but I also use it for work. Its compact size doesn't take up much space on my desk, and the key presses feel satisfying. The sleek all-black design adds to the aesthetics of my desk setup. Moreover, it offers excellent value for money, making it a hassle-free product. Logitech's reputation as a renowned brand is clearly built on the high satisfaction of users like me.Good Points:・Its compact ten-keyless design is fantastic for saving desk space.・The sharp and precise keypresses make it enjoyable not just for gaming but also for various tasks like work.・The backlighting allows for customization to match my mood or room ambiance.・The durable aluminum top plate gives me confidence in its longevity; I've been using it for over six months without any issues.Areas for improvement:・Due to its black color, it tends to accumulate dust if not cleaned regularly. Periodic brushing or wiping with a microfiber cloth is necessary, though it may not bother most users.・I wish the material of the wired cable was of higher quality. There's room for improvement, like making the cable slightly thicker for durability or using a fabric sheath as an upgrade.",
        "Logitech, whose keyboards I've used for 3 or 4 years, offered mostly rubber-dome affairs that felt like typing on Jell-O. But with this one, the G413: it's like Logitech reached into my head and pulled out exactly what kind of keyboard I would like and then built it for me. This keyboard is exactly what I need: fantastic white-only lighting, all the large characters are brightly lit, no obnoxious, onerous, bloaty software to install to control the lighting, very pleasing feel, and a very small footprint. It's no Model M SE TKL, but it's not trying to be, and at $50--quite literally a tenth of the price of a good Model M TKL today--it's plenty good enough.",
        "(black G413 TKL SE)No, this isn't a true budget mechanical (there are plenty of $25-$40 no-name mechanicals out there), though it's about as cheap as you'll find a true mechanical from a major brand-name maker....however, it's better made, with nicer materials, fit-n-finish and better key feel than the cheaper 'boards I've used and at a price that's still within reach for most gamers (or folks who just prefer the feel of mechanical over membrane).This \"SE\" version of the G413 was purchased to replace my first gen. G413, which suffered a failed W key after three years of nightly gaming use.  The SE has better key action and a more solid key feel than the earlier version, it also has more texture on the key cap surface and touts a new key cap material (this is a welcome upgrade, as I was starting to see the paint wear off around letters on my WASD keys on the OG version). The \"board\"/deck of the keyboard is similar to the older version, which is to say it's very solid and well made, but the SE forgoes the USB port and dual cable of the original, it also doesn't show up as a recognized device on Logitech's G Hub software anymore.Key feel is a personal preference, so my 5 stars may be your 1 star... I'd call these switches a blending of a Cherry brown and blue switch as far as character: they're sprung stiffer and have a more noticeable break point than a brown switch, but aren't as firm or crisp as a blue and more importantly, are as quiet as a brown switch, overall a very pleasant compromise in my book. If anything, I'd say they have a more solid feel than even genuine Cherry switches and easily best the first gen. Logitech mechanical and Chinese Cherry-esque switches in feel and solidity.I love this keyboard for the fact that it has a solid deck, good cable, great key feel and simple LED backlighting, I feel like it's a much better value than a no-name board for $30 less, or a top of the line name-brand board at up to hundreds of dollars more.Multi-color, per key programmable, flashing, color wave LED \"features\" add nothing to the gaming (or typing in subdued light) experience for me and I hate paying extra for stuff that I just have to figure out how to disable... Thanks Logitech!As far as TKL 'boards in general go, they're certainly not for everyone... I like TKL better than 60% (though I still miss my num pad) and it does still reclaim a sizeable chunk of real estate on my desk for mouse over-run compared to a full sized keyboard, which in my case is a real advantage in sweaty PvP gaming situations.Having directly accessible F keys and full size style arrow, del/ins, etc. keys is definitely worth the added width for me, but smaller desks or gaming only rigs might still be better with 60%, YMMV."

        "I've been searching for a solid microphone that won't break the bank, and after watching countless YouTube videos and checking various websites, I finally settled on the Razer Seiren V2 Pro USB Microphone. Here’s my experience with it:Sound QualityThe Seiren V2 Pro delivers clear, rich sound that makes my streams on Twitch and YouTube sound professional. The high-pass filter is great at cutting out low-frequency noise, so my voice comes through cleanly without any annoying background hums.Ease of UseSetting up the Seiren V2 Pro was super easy. The plug-and-play USB connection works perfectly with my PC, and it integrates seamlessly with Twitch and YouTube. The built-in mic monitoring and gain control are fantastic for making quick adjustments during my streams or recordings.Built-in Shock AbsorberThe built-in shock absorber is a lifesaver. It reduces vibrations and handling noise, which is especially useful during intense gaming sessions or animated podcast discussions.Mic WindsockThe included mic windsock is a nice touch. It effectively cuts down on those annoying plosive sounds (like \"p\" and \"b\" noises), ensuring my audio quality stays consistent.Design and BuildThe Seiren V2 Pro looks sleek and professional. It feels sturdy and well-built, and I’m confident it will last a long time.Pros:Great sound quality with a high-pass filterEasy USB setupReal-time mic monitoring and gain controlEffective shock absorber and mic windsockSleek designCons:Only USB connectivity, so no XLR optionMic monitoring can be a bit sensitive and may need adjustmentsConclusionThe Razer Seiren V2 Pro is a great USB microphone for streaming, gaming, recording, and podcasting (which I should be doing soon). It offers excellent sound quality, is easy to use, and has a solid build—all without breaking the bank. If you're looking for a reliable and professional-sounding microphone, the Seiren V2 Pro is definitely worth considering.",
        "This review is for the Razer Siren V2 X.Siren V2 X vs Siren MiniI chose the V2 X over the Mini because the Mini doesn't have a physical mute button, but I found a Reddit comment saying that it sounds like a professional microphone, and that it's much better than the Mini, so I felt better about paying twice as much for the V2 X than the Mini, which I initially couldn't justify doing for just the mute button.Siren V2 X vs Siren V2 ProI chose the V2 X instead of the V2 Pro because I looked up reviews on Youtube, and didn't like the sound of the Pro, and I assume dynamic microphones in general. The sound seems to catch the micro vibrations in the voice which I don't like, I guess it has too much resolution. Noise cancellation might be superior on dynamic microphones like the V2 Pro as well, but I've had cheap condenser mics like the ones that come attached to headsets all my life, so I know what I'm getting into.Software:There's some interesting features, like using the mic for your headphones, forwarding music / game audio through your mic, and mix it with the mic input. The software is not buggy, but the \"streamer mix\" features creates virtual inputs / outputs which Windows doesn't take nicely to, and can lead to errors. So just use something else for the mixing.Some reviewers have stated that the mic is always active even when muted, which wakes up the screen. That might've been fixed with an update. The mic shuts off completely when you press the button. No delays, no errors, nothing. It has never failed me, and the function does not require having the Razer software installed. I believe it operates at the driver level, which is good.Conclusion:Overall, I'm happy with the V2 X. I had to disable echo cancellation inside Discord, since it was not picking up my voice until I did. But that's the only issue I've had, and it wasn't with the mic itself. The mic is mostly made out of plastic, which I personally like. It's lighter so it puts less strain on the cheap boom arm I'm using. Also, I recommend getting a pop filter, the kind that's like a foam cover on the microphone head if you have fans nearby. There's boom arm bundles that come with pop filters. Any kind will work, even if they are meant for Blue Yeti, and it's a better deal than buying them separately.I'm actually using the mic with a strong fan right behind it. I do have to keep gain at 100, but the filter eliminates wind noise, and I can keep the mic comfortably about a feet and a half away from my face.",
        "Initially I purchased the Razer Seiren X (v1), just wanting something smaller than my previous \"studio mic\" setup which required a mic stand, mixer, etc. and took up way too much space. I was pleasantly surprised at just how well it worked, but it really irked me that it was micro-USB rather than USB-C (I've been trying to clean out old micro-USB devices) and I wondered if a different Razer mic came with one. To my surprise, there was a v2 of the same mic with USB-C I had just failed to do the proper research.I am happy to say the v2 is actually better than the first version, it picks up A LOT more than the other mic did so I don't have to be so close or force the gain up past it's maximum. Although the knob is free-spinning which I found odd, as the version prior had a minimum and maximum point but not the end of the world. Similar to the older version, there's a headphone jack pass-through on the back. Also, the USB-C cable is form-fitted to plug in and sit flush against the bottom of the mic. The only other difference is the older version was more of a condenser-style while v2 is more dynamic at least looks-wise. Oh and also the cable is a lot longer (and thicker) on v2 than v1, which was a nice bonus.Great mic, great price, I would gladly recommend this to anyone looking for a good \"gaming\" mic. I use mine on a Steam Deck, plugged into a Razer BlackWidow Chroma v2 just for reference."

        "I’m new to the custom keyboard hobby and love the coiled cable look against the keyboard, while also keeping cables tangle free at an affordable price.It’s just the right length and the cable feels highly durable. Although I get the intention of the 5-pin quick disconnect aviator, I’ll probably find myself just unplugging the USB-C directly. Albeit, it still looks super cool.Well packaged and neatly boxed. Highly satisfied!",
        "As a dedicated gamer and tech enthusiast, I’ve gone through my fair share of cables for my gaming keyboard, but this Custom Coiled USB C Cable stands out as one of the best I’ve used. Here's why:1. Premium Build Quality: The cable feels incredibly sturdy and well-constructed, with a durable yet flexible exterior. The coil is tight but not overly stiff, offering excellent strain relief. The USB C connectors themselves are high-quality, ensuring a solid, reliable connection without any wobbling or loose fits. This is crucial for a smooth gaming experience.2. Aesthetic Appeal: The coiled design gives a unique and stylish touch to any gaming setup. I opted for the custom color option, and it looks great with my RGB gaming keyboard. It’s a great way to add personality and flair to your desk while maintaining a professional, clean look.3. Functional Length: At 5 feet when fully extended, this cable offers a great balance between freedom of movement and keeping things neat. The coil ensures it doesn’t get in the way, but it still provides enough length for an organized and tidy workspace. Plus, it's resistant to tangling, which is a big bonus.Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with this Custom Coiled USB C Cable for my gaming keyboard. If you're in the market for a high-quality, reliable, and stylish cable, I highly recommend this product. It's a small investment that makes a noticeable difference in both performance and appearance.",
        "🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 The Cable That Saved My Sanity (and My Son’s Setup!)Let me start with a confession: My son is the ultimate “ask Dad, then ask Mom” expert. He’ll come to me first with questions about all things gaming, but when he doesn’t get the answer he wants, he immediately heads over to Mom – the Queen of Amazon Prime, aka “The Clicker of All Things Awesome.” We joke that people think we’re Amazon delivery drivers because of how often those brown boxes show up at our door. At one point, our neighbors actually thought we had an Amazon Prime delivery van!So, when my son decided his gaming keyboard wasn’t “pro” enough without a fancy custom coiled cable, guess who he came to first? Yup, me. After explaining to me the importance of a USB-C cable with a detachable aviator connector (because apparently that’s critical to victory in Fortnite), he wasn’t thrilled with my casual “just use the one you’ve got” response.Of course, Mom swoops in with her magical Prime powers, and within two days (thank you, Prime addiction), the GUNMJO Pro Custom Coiled USB-C Cable in sleek carbon black shows up at our doorstep.The Verdict:Top-Tier Build Quality: This thing is a beast. Double-sleeved for durability and the coiled design just screams pro-gamer. My son’s gaming setup now looks straight out of a sci-fi movie, and I have to admit, it’s a huge upgrade from his previous tangled mess of a cable.Detachable Metal Aviator Connector: I thought the “aviator connector” was just some flashy gimmick, but nope! It’s actually super convenient and adds a rugged, industrial vibe to the setup. My son swaps out keyboards all the time, and now he can do it effortlessly, like some kind of tech wizard.Perfect Length: At 1.5 meters, this cable is long enough to reach his gaming tower without cluttering the desk, but short enough to avoid the dreaded cable spaghetti under his desk. It’s like the Goldilocks of USB cables—just right.Performance Boost?: Okay, maybe it’s just the placebo effect, but my son swears his keystrokes feel more responsive with this cable. I’m not sure if that’s true, but hey, if he’s happy, I’m happy.Sleek Carbon Black Design: This cable is a head-turner. The matte black finish fits perfectly with his all-black gaming setup, giving it that professional, clean look he’s always wanted. Now, his friends are asking where they can get one!The Bottom Line: My son’s over the moon with his GUNMJO cable, and I’m just happy I don’t have to hear about the “laggy old cable” anymore. Kudos to Amazon Prime and my wife for always saving the day (and my sanity). If you’re looking to upgrade your setup with a top-notch USB-C cable, trust me, this one’s a game-changer. Just ask my son—or better yet, ask my wife! 😂"

        "This little computer is perfect for the home office. I have both Mac PCs and Windows PCs. The Mac is always my go to PC. Not only is it easy to use. It also come with great software that will handle 90% of tasks that the average person needs; from common office tasks, media (audio, video, photo) processing and content creation without spending an extra dime on software. However, there are some tasks where a specific software is required and only available for Windows PCs. If that is the case, then the Mac Mini may not be what you want.The Mac Mini stood out for me based on its low price and small foot print. I traveled with a Macbook Pro but for the home, I need a bigger screen (mine is connected to a 34\", 4K LG monitor) and so the Mac Mini is the perfect choice balancing price and performance. I chose the cheapest Mac Mini as it suits my needs. If your need required more processing power/RAM/storage; there are several options that you can choose in the Mac Mini line. They have enough ports to connect to 2 monitors, USB drives/webcam. If you don't already have a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, you will need to add them to the system price.Please note that the amount of RAM and storage can't be upgraded by the end user, especially the RAM upgrade. Storage limitation is easier to fix. You can add a high capacity external HD/SSD based on your needs and financial situation. I hope this little bit of advise is helpful.",
        "I recently upgraded to the Mac mini, and I'm absolutely blown away by its performance and functionality. As an avid Apple user, I had high expectations, and this compact powerhouse exceeded them in every aspect. Let me share with you why it deserves all the praise it's been receiving.First off, let's talk about performance. The integration of Apple's M2 chip has taken the Mac mini to a whole new level. It's lightning-fast, handling even the most demanding tasks with ease. Whether I'm tackling intensive creative projects or juggling multiple applications simultaneously, the Mac mini delivers seamless performance without breaking a sweat.Beyond its impressive performance, the design of the Mac mini is sleek and elegant. It fits seamlessly into any workspace, occupying minimal space while still exuding sophistication. The attention to detail in its craftsmanship is evident, making it a pleasure to have on my desk.Connectivity options are another highlight of the Mac mini. With Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4 ports, I have lightning-fast data transfer speeds and a wide range of peripheral connections at my disposal. Whether I need to hook up multiple displays, external storage devices, or other accessories, the Mac mini offers unparalleled versatility.Finally, I appreciate Apple's dedication to sustainability with the eco-conscious design of the Mac mini. It's made with recyclable materials and energy-efficient components, reducing its environmental footprint. As someone who values sustainability, this aligns perfectly with my values.In terms of recommendations, I recommend an Apple keyboard (unless you have another high-class product) with this computer. It helps a lot for a good quality of typing. Also, beware that if you want to use it for programs requiring more graphic card power (such as data mining), M2 may not give you what you are looking for, or at least, you may need some upgrades to get the best out of it.In conclusion, the Mac mini is a true game-changer in the world of computing. Its exceptional performance, sleek design, extensive connectivity options, user-friendly interface, and commitment to sustainability make it a standout choice for professionals and tech enthusiasts alike. I wholeheartedly give it a solid five stars and highly recommend it to anyone in search of a remarkable computing experience.",
        "As expected, this Apple mini-mac works great with my Amazon monitor. It meets all my needs so far as speed, power, performance and convenience. The small profile does not take up much room on the desk.But... I also bought the AppleCare package, just in case. You never know."

        "So I have multiple mice I've been testing out.Razer Deathadder Chroma was my old mouse but after 8 years or so the middle scroll wheel broke, I had no problems with this mouse but it was wired.Razer Viper wired - worked great, but the scroll wheel was rough and made my fingertip feel numb. Also if I had macros for scroll forward and scroll backwards on the scroll wheel, it would sometimes hit the wrong direction.Logitech Hero - The mouse sensor itself was fantastic, but the scroll wheel came in two modes, and the normal mode felt very cheap - also it's click responsiveness felt slower than the ...Corsair Dark Core - Click responsiveness is crisp, feels great, but it is rather heavy... Which might not sound like a problem, but it is, its hard to snap or quickly reposition especially without tiring out your hand over longer durations. But the battery life is also only 24 hours, so you have to charge it every night..I compared the most impressive of the mice Ive had so far, the Corsair Dark Core, to this Master mouse on the responsiveness test and I actually score slightly higher on the performance with this mouse than I do with the Corsair. I do feel the cursor accuracy on the screen is smoother with the Dark Core, but I believe because the mouse weighs so little I am able to click more accurately and across the screen quicker with this mouse.This mouse feels like there is nothing at the part where your palm rests (weight wise), the very little weight this mouse does have does seem to be more toward to front. The click is crisp, the plastic is pretty nice although I can tell a slight quality difference between this and the Corsair, this one does feel a bit cheaper. It does say \"Made by China\" right under it. The scroll wheel is super silent and smooth, and tbh I think I like the feel of the scroll wheel more with this mouse than all of the others, although I can tell it is slightly cheaper material.Other comparable mice I looked at that fit all my criteria were generally like $175. I know there are good alternatives but I wanted a smooth scroll wheel that scrolls smoothly, a regular design, cheap, two side buttons, no extra buttons that might accidentally be clicked, lightweight, wireless, and it had to have competitive responsive results to other high end gaming mice. This one checks all the boxes.I use a 32\" 1440p monitor, so when I take this mouse accuracy responsiveness test I assume it is probably a little harder because the size and resolution of my screen is much larger than the average, but maybe it isn't and you could compare your score to what I scored with this mouse.",
        "They're gonna raise the price on this for sure. It's 25 bucks but usually has a sale or coupon which will bring it to like 20-22 after tax.Listen, it's lightweight, good battery life, great button press, good build quality, and the sensor I can tell no difference between this and my Logitech G series or razor mouse. It's just as good if not better than either of those. And the weight man. It's light as a feather! Has like 7 DPI modes and each has a color to tell you which one you're on. It's probably the best budget tier item I've ever bought. The price is budget but everything else is mid to upper tier quality. If you want an awesome gaming mouse that cost next to nothing, this is the one. For this price I can afford to buy a couple more for my other computers around the house. It's fantastic man. I love it.I enabled the lights for the picture but I use eco mide to save the battery.PS. - One single side note. It is a larger mouse. And the click is towards the front of the mouse. Your hand is quite sprawled while using this, so if you need to have more of a smaller mouse so you can perch your hand like a claw, for best control, just keep in mind this mouse isn't totally optimal imo for competitive gaming. It's a little too big imo. And My hands are even large, and it's still large. You'll see what I mean, it doesn't allow for much pivoting when your wrist is against the mouse pad. Try it out, but if the size and shape don't give you the control you need send it back. Other than this matter of preference issue, I think it'll suit most casual gamers, and it will surely satisfy anyone else who isn't gaming. It's very accurate and smooth functioning. I'm not knocking it, it just doesn't quite have the feel I look for to game all day, or to gane competitively. It's simply too big for that. But for the price definitely buy this, I'm sure you'll use it for something no matter what.",
        "I’ve always wanted a gaming mouse! This gaming mouse was budget friendly and still functions amazing. It has a high precision sensor and has 7 adjustable DPI levels. You can easily customize the speed your mouse moves by pressing a button below the scrolling wheel.This mouse also has 9 adjustable RGB backlit options. I personally love how it continues to change colors as you use it. This mouse has the option to connect wirelessly and also wired, which is provided. The mouse has a built-in 1000 MAH battery which can last up to 40 hours with the backlight on and 75 hours with the backlight off. That is an amazing battery life. Not to mention, it would only take 1.5 hours to fully recharge with a type C charging port.You can either connect this gaming mouse with a 2.4 GHz wireless connection and a dual Bluetooth 5.3 connection. You are easily able to switch between three devices, since you’re given three different connection options. I was able to connect this to my laptop very easily. It came pre-charged as well so it was ready to use. Keep in mind, this is a gaming mouse, however, you can use this for work or personal use as well. I think it looks very cool and performs really nice. It has soft clicks and the scroll wheel is very smooth.The design of this mouse is made so your hand rests comfortably for long hours. It has a sleep feature, which is activated if the mouse is untouched for a few minutes. This allows the mouse to save battery time as well. If you want to use this mouse without the back light, you can switch it to Eco mode.I really like how this mouse is compatible with multiple devices. I have no issues with this mouse, and I would like to say that I find it better than the traditional mouse that you are used to!!"

        "I wanted to move our Home Automation System software from a Raspberry PI to a Virtual Machine operating on Windows 11.I discovered a review of the GMKtec Mini PC Windows 11 Pro Intel N5105, 8GB RAM 128GB Hard Drive Desktop Mini Computer for under $140. Though I’d give it a chance…Wow! Initial setup went quickly and smoothly. Performance surprisingly quick. Installed the VM software, created the Virtual Machine and proceeded with Home Assistant software installation and setup.Everything went smoothly. The system has been in service for 60 days and operating flawlessly! The computer is quiet and runs cool. I am very pleased and impressed!The only drawback is actually on me. The 128GB SSD is the bare minimum and space is limited. Thank goodness for the MicroSD Slot where I installed a 256GB MicroSD Card. In hindsight, I should have purchased the next level up with the 256GB SSD.…ADDITIONAL INFO:Now a second opportunity arrived.I use a Windows 10 PC for operating a small CNC Machine. This computer is Windows 11 incompatible. The motherboard and processor could be upgraded at a cost of $200.I decided to purchase the next level up, the GMKtec Mini PC N97 Windows 11 Pro, G5 Micro, 12th Gen Intel Alder Lake N97 (up to 3.60GHz) 12GB DDR5 256GB Hard Drive Mini Desktop Computer for $150.Again, initial setup went quickly and smoothly. Performance surprisingly quick. All but one software package installed smoothly and quickly. The only drawback is the Arduino IDE software, which stalls when opening. I intend to troubleshoot; I believe it is due to incompatible video driver. Should be easy to solve…PROS:Great performance for the priceRuns quietRuns coolVery small footprintWired and Wireless WiFi connectivity (wireless WiFi works very well in a location where other wireless devices have trouble with weak signal)Bluetooth connectivityMicroSD SlotCONS:Specialty software (Arduino IDE) incompatibility, possibly due to incompatible video driver.",

        "As with most products now, the instructions in the box are skimpy.  But shortly after purchase the manufacturer sent an unsolicited email with a link to online support in case a purchaser needs more info.  The instructions there are detailed and turned up something surprising:  With at least some computers, you'll need to click a box changing the default from Region 4 to Region 1.  With DVDs, the US is in Region 1.  Easy to do.  But frustrating if you don't realize you need to do it.",

Use is intuitive and, in my case, it was better for me not to use their user manual .pdf they sent me unprompted in an email. (This demonstration of a sincere effort that they want to make sure that they are covering all bases to ensure their customers are successful using their product is an unexpected plus.)  The customer service is really on top of things, too.  They are lightning fast at responding which is also a wonderful surprise.",
        "I just got it today as stated and the reviews were right- I connected it to my laptop and immediately played, ripped my 2 CD's with no hitch. I hope this is not a premature review but if it will last as I hope, then I  really impressed. My only complaint is there should be more info in the small and very brief manual and it came in its store box - not much padding like what Amazon usually does specially with what I think a machine should be amply and safely packaged. It felt solid, not flimsy at all. I feel like it could easily fit in my thin laptop case pr even a medium size purse. If it lasts for a long time, then it is more than worth the cost. The 2 cables ( connecting cables are short but adequate and a big plus is one of the two is imbedded at the bottom of the item- so there is no chance of it getting lost. There is nothing in the manual identifying the cords that came with it- or their specific uses. The eject button worked beautifully. The speed by which it ripped my CDs' was good but could be faster- I am.notcomplaining tho. I have not burnt copies yet so I do not know how that could be. By the way, I do not know if I need to charge theMachine to power it- because the manual does.not have information about that. I am of the older generation ans not so familiar with connections."

        "I’m genuinely impressed by the quality of this switch, especially considering how affordable it is. It feels well-made and performs exactly as advertised. I own several other KVM and various types of switches, but none have worked as seamlessly as this one. It consistently registers both mouse and keyboard inputs accurately, with no noticeable delay, which is crucial for my workflow, given how much I type and rely on my mouse.This switch has been a game-changer for managing my work and personal setups. It keeps one monitor active across both my work docking station and home PC, allowing me to switch between devices instantly to game, study, or get work done. I highly recommend it—it’s a fantastic deal at this price!",
        "This does the job of switching peripherals between two computers quite well. Even the two USB cables to connect to the computers was included. The indicator light showing which output is selected is a bit dim, but far better than the eye-stabbingly bright LEDs on some equipment!",
        "This is a simple yet really useful USB 2.0 switch. It allows you to use up to 4 USB 2.0 devices with two different computers.In my case, I bought it to use one set of keyboard and mouse between my two Mac minis, as my desk is not big enough to accommodate two sets. Besides, I use the two Mac minis for different purposes and don’t need to type or mouse on them at the same time. So this switch is perfect.The product description, packaging and manual say this is “2 in 4 out.” This makes no sense to me. What you are getting is a switch that allows you to connect up to 4 USB peripherals like mouse, keyboard, trackpad, printer, USB drives (but at only USB 2.0 speeds), etc.  For USB storage devices you need a microUSB cable to power the switch; I tried this by connecting the cable from my Mac mini but found the transfer speeds to be abysmal by 2023 standards, so I’m only using the switch for my keyboard and mouse. Which is what this switch is best for. Maybe a wired printer is okay with the USB 2.0 speed.This product is useful and easy to use. It comes with two USB A cables to connect to your computers. It doesn’t need power if just connecting keyboard and mouse. Great product."

The microphone recording quality is very clear, too! Best of all, all of these come with a reasonable price. 10/10 microphone, I would recommend!",

        "This Switching USB HUB delivers on all its promises. Smooth Switching back & forth between computers. I use Logitech Wireless Mouse & Keyboard + a 256GB USB Drive i share between computers and the switch is FAST AND SEAMLESS. Very few of these USB HUBS out there come apart easily for mounting under the desk. This is the 3rd one i've identified. I'll link those below if your looking for an easy solution for Under Desk Mounting. As with all of them that come apart easy the back cover is just held on by 4-6 or so clips. Most USB HUBS i can't figure out how to get them apart. You'll need a TINY Flathead Screwdriver to separate the back. It's always been quick and easy. A minute or 2 you should have the back off. I did however break one of the clip as i think i've done on every one i've tried bc you're blindly hunting around for the clips to release. Breaking 1 or even 2 Will make no difference since you have at least another 4 clips to hold it together - not to mention all the ones i've tried have mounting pegs/dowels that help to hold everything in place and line everything up.Having said that i've attached some pics to help anyone do this flawlessly. Sorry, i forgot to get pics of the back screwed in under the desk before i snapped everything back together. So for reference i've attached pics that show you exactly where the mounting clips are and areas to put your screws. DO NOT PUT YOUR MOUNTING SCREW/S OVER ANY METAL PARTS INSIDE. There's plenty of room to find mounting spots.1st Two Pics are Post Mount. PIC 3 shows the back cover separated from the rest of the HUB and you can also see part of the hub with PCB Board. I've Highlighted in Yellow where the clips are. There's 2 on the back and front long side of the backplate and 2 on the skinny or narrow side. PIC 4 is just of the backplate and i've highlighted ALL OF THE CLIPS In Yellow. PIC 5 is of the PCB BOARD with all the electronics, ports, etc... I've put YELLOW ARROWS as to where to put the screws through on the backplate so when you put everything back together there's no contact with anything metal and the screws are low profile so they shouldn't even touch the board. PIC 6 is the type of screws i used. They're just random screws for computer stuff i've accumulated over the years that i threw in a box and they all have a point on the end of them. DO NOT use screws with a flat end. For reference i took a pic of the screws next to a bottle cap. NOTICE - they all have a flange on them which really helps for holding everything down. I predrilled the holes with a tiny Drill Bit after lining up the backplate and getting it just where i wanted it. Start with 1 screw, get it where you want it and the rest are a piece of cake. DO NOT over tighten as the screw can snap off. Just good & snug is all you need. I just used 3 or 4 screws. I mean it's an almost weightless USB HUB - it doesn't take much to secure it. It's a 15 - 20 Minute Job TOPS.As for other USB 3.x HUBs I've found that come apart easily for Under Desk Mounting- Anker 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub with 5Gbps Data Transfer: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XMD7KPU - I've been using this since like 2017. I have a review on it as well and go over Under Desk Mounting- SABRENT 4 Port USB 3.0 Hub with Individual LED Lit Power Switches :  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TPMEOYMBeen using this one for a couple of years, Works great, and i like it bc you can turn ports on and off with the press of a button.",
        "I recently purchased this USB 3.0 switch to simplify my setup between my work laptop and home desktop, and I couldn't be happier. This switch makes sharing peripherals between multiple computers a breeze. Just plug in the devices (like my keyboard, mouse, and external hard drive) into the switch, and with a single button press, I can seamlessly switch between my devices.The USB 3.0 speed is fantastic—I haven't noticed any lag when transferring files or even using my webcam across both computers. The build quality feels solid, and I appreciate the compact design, which saves space on my desk.Installation was also a breeze; it was as simple as plug-and-play, with no additional drivers required. This device has been a game-changer, saving me from constantly plugging and unplugging devices. It’s an excellent, practical solution for anyone with a multi-computer setup and has really streamlined my workspace. Highly recommended!",
        "Works great with a wired mouse and keyboard! However, it Does not work with any external USB hard drive. I tried 3 different drives. I used the power cable suppled with 3 different power supplies, two of them more beefy, like ipad charger and 2.4 ma charger. Nothing worked with any of the hard drives! The drives just made clicking noises. I was offered a replacement from their very responsive tech support, but it did not work with the hard drives either! The drives work fine when connected directly to the PC.When drive is connected to USB switch, there is some acknowledgement by the PC that it was plugged in. There is a windows sound, and it does show up as a device. However, it never gets a drive letter, and the drive just makes clicking noises. This is bad for the hard drive!When I plug the drive (or any other of 3 drives that I have tried) into the PC directly, it comes up almost immediately as drive letter D:. Works fine without USB switch, does NOT work with USB switch! I have tried several different power supplies as well with no success.I will be returning the switch to Amazon for full refund."

        "I’ve built many PCs for myself over the years but I decided to try a pre-built system for once and this Asus feels like i made a good choice. First, it comes with a keyboard and mouse. Unexpected. Booted it up to the basic Windows 11 setup and was happy to see very little add-on software. It just has the Asus utility software to manage the hardware functions. There was an offer for MS office and a Mcafee antivirus which I declined and removed. Loaded up some games and performance is great. It’s just below top of the line which is something I aim for when building. The prices of components are more affordable but everything runs well. I've used Asus parts in the past and never had issues.I don’t really think the glass side and lights are important butvit is a good way to inspect the inside.Overall, I would recommend this to others.",
        "Owned for a month now with no issues. Upgraded to this machine from an HP Victus gaming laptop with a 3050ti and and Ryzen 7.  The ROG smokes the laptop.  Purchased specifically to run MSFS2020 and it does so very nicely.  Easy to set up, and no technical issues thus far.  Pretty happy with this investment.",
        "I purchased this computer on Prime Day and got what I thought was a good deal. However, the computer arrived defective or possibly broken. It failed to detect any monitors, keyboards, or mouse devices I tried. The tower booted up and the lights activated but it just went to  a black screen. This is completely unacceptable after spending $1000+ on the item. Amazon only allowed for a refund and refused to replace the computer with a working one, which seems like they are refusing to honor the Prime Day deal I was supposed to get on this computer. 0/5 stars, did not even work from day 1."

        "For the first 24 hours, I was really impressed. Really snappy performance, 8 GB of RAM was plenty for simple tasks, and the SSD was capacious at 256 GB, considering the price. The inclusion of Windows Pro made the box almost free! However, after updating to Windows 11 Build 22H3, during the process of applying updates, the computer locked up. After 60 minutes with the computer no longer visible on the network and the keyboard and mouse non-responsive, pulled the power cord. Upon restoring power and turning on the computer, the PC was stuck for hours at the spinning circle during boot.Two more power-cycles and Windows repair interface appeared. Selected Windows Reset, Local Source (wouldn't work with cloud source), Windows began resetting. However, after a restart, computer back to the infinitely spinning circle. :-(If this had proved reliable, I'd have bought a dozen or more as remote monitoring PCs for client networks. But given that I've had good luck with the similarly priced AWOW models, I will not be investing any more money or time in the GMKTek offerings.Update 01-07-2024-----------------------Fortunately, GMKTek provides a download for a Windows 11 re-installation ISO. With this and leveraging a fair amount of knowledge of Windows installation options, was able to re-image the SSD. Unfortunately, the product key is invalidated and I had to use a spare Windows 10 product key to re-activate Windows. Unfortunate the GMKTek hasn't worked out the same relationship with Microsoft that Dell has, whereby any Windows 11 ISO used to load Windows onto a Dell OptiPlex results in an automatically activated Windows 11 installation.Bottom line is that after recreating and updating all apsects of the re-installed Windows 11 OS, the PC is back to running normally. I know to steer clear now of some driver updates. The PC has been running for about 36 hours and I'll post an update if that changes in the near future.When this PC works, it represents a great value for the money in terms of hardware specs and a Windows 11 license. However, taking into account the time issue remediation takes and the expertise required, the TCO (total cost of ownership) rises significantly. If I never have to do brain surgery on this device again, I'll still feel the cost was justified based on the performance of this sub-$200 device.P.S. I now make a complete image backup before running/installing ANY updates so I can simply restore the image backup rather than running into yet another Windows 11 re-installation process and the requirement to use/purchase another Windows product key.P.P.S. The WIndows 11 re-installation ISO download was 11 GB and was not a standard Windows 11 installation ISO. This had to be burned to a flash drive (I used a 16 GB USB3 model; I used Rufus to create the bootable UEFI flash drive) and then the GMKTek PC booted with it. Upon boot, I was faced with a terminal window and a couple of choices. The one I chose led to an image/sysprep process that fortunately got the PC bootable once again with Windows 11 Pro.P.P.P.S. Highly recommended --> As soon as you boot the device for the first time, find a tool such as ProduKey by NirSoft and extract and save the Windows 11 product key. Ideally (although I didn't have a chance to test), this key would work if a re-install was ever required. The other option, that I was waiting for until the PC was fully updated, is to create an image backup using any number of tools, including the image backup tool in Windows. Thus, if any of your update processes results in a non-bootable PC, you can simply re-image from the backup and avoid having a non-activated instance of Windows 11.Update 01-12-2024-----------------------Vendor reached out proactively and offered some assistance, although I'd resolved the corrupt Windows 11 issue independently. However, that level of customer support is remarkable considering the price of this product and the lack of such support from other vendors with much pricier offerings. Due to this, upgrading the rating to four stars.Update 01-13-2024-----------------------Customer support proactively reached out and provided a product key so I could activate Windows 11 and free up my personal product key. GMKtec's proactive reaching out to a customer with issues is almost unparalleled in my experience over 40 years, so despite the issues I encountered, I'm raising my review to five stars. For a product this inexpensive but with excellent performance, providing this level of customer support is laudable.",
        "Didn't waste time setting it up since it is Windows 11. Took a while but finally had all the updates installed. The first test was 4k video on YouTube - no issues. Network speed on fiber was almost 400mbs. The green color plastic case is nice, and wife thinks it's cute. Pretty snappy for what it is - paid $137 and it is well worth it. Basically, as much as a Raspberry Pi but $37 dollars more for memory and a hard drive. Loaded some GIS software to test performance and didn't see any issues there either. Loaded a fancontrol program for more refined control. Will test more but am very satisfied👍FEW DAYS LATERI bought this little PC ($135) for streaming TV and web browsing from a hotel. In the past I purchased a travel router and a streaming TV dongle, and it worked OK. This G3 is substantially better, is a great deal with all the hardware and Windows 11. The TVs picture is substantially better than the Chromecast while running the same YouTube TV app on the same TV.There were a number of settings I had to figure out but it's well worth it. First I like using a Bluetooth mouse with Windows accessibility virtual keyboard. The fan was a little loud but go to GetFanControl and read what their software does. The bios is very functional also with many settings but didn't change any yet. Had to change settings on my Samsung TV for the way the TV monitors USB connections. Turned it all off to work properly.It's a PC so it has all the same issues - updates, power settings, etc. but WOW! Connect to TV, log into Wi-Fi and you're up and running. Purchased an air mouse with keyboard and track pad but a regular mouse works well and less complicated. I didn't know my TV could look this good. You will need to figure out how to use the power button to hibernate and turn on. Once I turn it on I have to move the mouse to get a picture but as I mentioned - ITS A NICE NUC👍 for a TV streaming and web browsing from a hotel.

        "My laptop stopped charging while in use and the battery was dying within half an hour. At first I looked at cheap laptops since I don’t have heavy use of it anymore (use iPad for mobile entertainment) but the specs on cheap laptops were terrible.  Then I thought of getting a little box like this since I already had monitor, keyboard, etc.  So for $130 I have a desktop with nice specs and if I really want I can get a second monitor.  Set up really easy, lots of ports (doesn’t have USB-C but can live without). Had an external drive so transferred files.  Great buy for my situation."

        "This mini PC comes in fairly minimalist packaging—you get a power adapter, a VESA mounting bracket, and an HDMI cable that (surprisingly) supports the full 95Hz refresh rate of my Pixio display.Oddly enough, there are stickers on the PC that recommend going through setup before connecting it to the internet to speed up the process. Normally, I connect the PC to WiFi or Ethernet during the setup, but this time I followed the advice on the stickers, and the setup was very quick. I was up and running at the desktop before I knew it.Pros:- for the low price, this machine does anything you need for basic daily computing, including: 4K HDR YouTube, high refresh rate displays (60Hz is archaic even for basic day-to-day usage), and of course your basic suite of applications—messaging, email, office applications, browsing the web.- I was even able to fire up Half-Life 2 (yes I know it's not a demanding game in 2024, but this is a Celeron we're talking about) and play around 30-40fps at the default video settings. Tweaking it further can achieve 60fps, but impressive for the money, nonetheless.- It's tiny! It fits anywhere on your desk—or under it- It has a detachable base with an upgradeable M.2 SSD!- Decent I/O, including 4 USB-A ports, two HDMI ports, Ethernet, and a headphone jack- Built-in Bluetooth, so wireless peripherals can make for a super clean desk setupCons:- Obviously since it's so tiny, the fan noise gets pretty loud under load. Nothing crazy, but something to consider if you're not wearing headphones- Not a gaming machine! Celeron integrated graphics might run Half-Life 2, but basically any smart toaster can as well. Do not expect this to play any AAA titles.- Yes, you can probably get a more powerful used PC for similar money with an actual graphics card, but in the landscape of brand new cheap PCs, this is not badOverall, it's a decent little PC, and while it comes with Windows 11 (suitable for most people), it can probably be even better with a lightweight Linux-based system, if not a little server! Small form factor, decent I/O, quick setup, Windows 11 support, and even dual display output makes it a bargain.",
        "This is a remarkable computer at a rock-bottom price.  The processor on mine is an Intell H100, which is about as fast as a 10-year old Intel i5.  But unlike an older computer, mine has a 500GB fast NVME SSD, which makes the system very responsive.  It also supports two 4K monitors, two USB 2 and two USB 3 ports.  Also it is as light as a laptop and uses less power than most.  This is the perfect computer for most people who still want a real monitor and keyboard.However, it does come with an unusal version of Windows 11 Pro.  First thing I noticed when I powered it up is that Chrome was present on the desktop.  Never saw that before.  So I told Windows to reset the system, with a fresh copy of Windows downloaded from the Internet.  When it came up, Chrome was still there.  Never saw that either.So I zeroed the drive, downloaded Windows on another machine, and installed Windows from a flash drive.  Chrome was no longer on the desktop, but now I had Windows 11 Home, instead of Pro.  Never, ever saw that before.I conclude that the system comes with a special version of Windows, probably the one used in China.  I call in PRC windows.  Is that bad?  I say No.  Because if that bothers you, you can still download and install a 100% genuine US version of Windows for free.  Microsoft knows the machine is licensed, and you don't need an activation code to install and use Windows 11 Home.I also installed Ubuntu Linux on it, and now I dual boot the machine.I recommended this machine to a friend, and he loves it.  I've also recommended it to my computer club, and mostly everyone else who will listen.  However I always, always, tell them it comes with PRC Windows.",

        "I don't usually write reviews, but I'm really impressed with this USB hub that allows you to expand one USB port on your computer to four additional ports. It arrived very quickly in the mail and was exactly as described. It truly was plug-and-play—no additional drivers were necessary.This product has been a lifesaver for me. My work laptop had lost one USB port due to technical issues, which was frustrating since I could only use one USB drive at a time. With this USB hub, the problem has been solved quickly and efficiently. Although it's only been a day since I started using it, it's working perfectly as advertised. I've noticed no lag or performance differences compared to directly plugging devices into the computer. Overall, I'm thoroughly satisfied with this purchase!",

        "EDIT 10/23/2024: Since this item seemed to work fairly well on my Xbox Series X and helped give extra USB ports for all its add-on's, I decided to buy a 2nd one for my Playstation 5's extra add-on's! So far it works just as great!ORIGINAL: Although it feels extremely cheap, and you do get what you pay for (and this is already a low price), it does seem to hold up well and work great so far. I needed it for extra USB ports for more add-on's for my Xbox Series X. I then stuck it to the back of my XBSX with velcro strips. I only needed 2 ports for now, so having a total of 4 for the port capacity leaves me plenty of room for more crazy additions and mods. The cord length is a little short as you can tell by the tape measurer comparison picture, but for what I needed it for, I didn't need much. So far, if you can get past the cheap feel of it, I'd definitely recommend it!"

        "Loved the rgb. The keyboard is a bit sensitive yet comfortable and the space bar does squeak a little. The headset is amazing. The mouse feels great on the hand thought i was worried the R/L clickers were too big, it did not hurt its performance at all. It's all wired so no batteries, seller could emphasize that so no one gets confused. The keyboard/mouse pad is of quality. One thing is the rgb strip is a set lineup of colors, i would have preferred a single color since its not programmable it kinda makes my underdesk light up like a Christmas tree but it still makes the set much sweeter. I might have skipped the instructions from the excitement but the rgb programming is simple, i just wish you could dim the lighting some for my poor wife at night. Overall great product great price.",

The keyboard and mouse are responsive and comfortable, perfect for long gaming sessions. The headset provides clear sound quality and the LED XL mouse pad adds a cool aesthetic. The included stand and RGB light strip are fantastic bonuses that enhance the overall experience. Everything in this 6-in-1 bundle works seamlessly together, making it an excellent value for any gamer. Highly recommended!",
        "Everything in this bundle worked as intended. Didn't see much use for the string of RGB lights. Especially when considering how many outlets and plugs it all takes. Otherwise it’s a good choice for an overall replacement for a wide variety."

        "Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts! I've gotta tell you about this nifty little device I've bought not once, but twice - the TP-Link UB500 Bluetooth 5.0 adapter. This thing is a game changer, especially for us gamers.First off, the plug-and-play feature is a dream. Just pop it into your PC and you're ready to roll. No messing around with complicated setups or anything like that. It's a real time-saver.Now, let's talk specs. This adapter uses the latest Bluetooth 5.0 plus EDR technology and is backward compatible with Bluetooth V4.2/4.0/3.0/2.1/2.0/1.1. It's a tiny thing, weighing just 2 grams and measuring 0.58\"L x 0.27\"W x 0.74\"H. But don't let its size fool you - it packs a punch!I mainly use this adapter for my Xbox controller, and let me tell you, it's been a revelation. The connection is rock solid - no lag, no dropouts, nothing. It's like having a wired connection, but without the actual wire. Freedom!The adapter works with all sorts of devices - laptops, desktops, mice, keyboards, you name it. And it's backward compatible with older Bluetooth versions, so it's got all your devices covered.The speed and coverage are top-notch. They claim it's twice as fast and has four times the coverage of Bluetooth 4.0, and I believe it. My Xbox controller has never felt more responsive.The design is another big plus. It's so small and sleek, you can leave it in your USB port and forget it's even there. It doesn't get in the way of anything else.Just a heads up, though - it's not compatible with Mac, Linux, TV, or Windows 8, and it's for PC use only. But if you're a Windows user like me, it's all good.So, to wrap up, if you're in the market for a reliable, high-performance Bluetooth adapter for your Xbox controller (or any other device, really), you can't go wrong with the TP-Link UB500. It's got my seal of approval!",
        "I've gone through a number of generic off brand bluetooth adapters. Some with antennas that you'd think would increase range or whatnot but for some reason they are all terrible.But this thing for just $15 has worked near flawlessly since the moment I got it. Literally plug and play with both windows and linux. And its nice and low profile as well, making it an easy addition to any device.If you need to add bluetooth to a device, just get this, it's worth every penny.",
        "All you have to do is plug it into your pc or whatever and you've got bluetooth. My motherboard didn't come with bluetooth (or wifi) but i was able to add bluetooth for basically free."

        "I really liked the color scheme of the keyboard, however it would not hold a charge. I tried different charging cables and different outlets to be sure, tried charging for hours and it was completely dead. The mouse worked fine. I set up a return with Amazon and received an exchange the next day, but it had the exact same issue. I am returning this one too and shopping for a different keyboard/ mouse combo.",

While it is similarly priced to the latest Raspberry Pi, it offers much better CPUs, larger memory and storage, and, more importantly, it runs very quietly and is energy-efficient. You can easily install Linux on this machine and run all your services on this tiny box. Additionally, it has an UHD 16 iGPU, which enables hardware acceleration for transcoding in Jellyfin.",

        "Update:  12/2/2021I have been using this switch for nearly 3 years, switching between personal and work computers every single weekday, sometimes multiple times a day in that time, as well as moving it to a new desk setup, and it has worked and continues to work flawlessly.  I am very pleased with this device and cannot recommend it highly enough, even if it were to fail tomorrow.Original Review:I set up a docking station for my work laptop at my home office desk where I also use my personal computer.  I quickly realized that swapping USB adapters for mouse and keyboard every time I wanted to switch between work and personal computers was a hassle and unnecessary wear and tear on the ports.  Once I also realized that the built-in DAC in my work laptop was garbage when I was trying to listen to some music on Pandora while I worked, I decided to look for a USB switch and came across this one.I am happy to report that the UGREEN USB 3.0 switch works almost perfectly with my setup.  I have it connected to my personal computer and my laptop dock.  Plugged into the front, I have my mouse adapter, wired keyboard, and a standalone DAC.  I even used the 4th USB port for another keyboard adapter so that I can use my wireless keyboard from my couch when I want to switch the computer display over to my TV, and this works great as well.Pressing the button on top of the UGREEN unit quickly switches control from one computer to another with no delay.  A small, non-intrusive blue LED indicates which computer is active.  Mouse, keyboard, and the audio DAC all immediately work correctly on the selected computer.  The only thing that I sometimes have issues with is if the computer I am switching to is asleep.  In that case, moving the mouse or pushing a key on the keyboard does not wake up the computer like it normally would, and I have to press the power button on the computer to wake it up.  I'm not sure why this happens but it seems like if the USB connection was not active when the computer was put to sleep, it does not make the connection until it is manually woken up.  I have checked in my power settings to make sure that USB ports are not turned off when the computer is asleep, as this would be an obvious cause for the issue, but that is not the case.  This is a minor inconvenience since my personal computer and dock power buttons are both easily accessible, but would be nice if it worked.The UGREEN unit is quite small and sits inconspicuously on my desk on top of my audio mixer.  To keep the cables managed cleanly I do have to make a 180 degree bend with my two wired connections (keyboard and DAC) to route the cables back behind the switch.  If I just had 4 USB adapters plugged in, that wouldn't be an issue.  The only way to fix this would be to have all the ports on the back, and then the unit would have to be larger in size to accommodate 6 ports on one side instead of 4.The switch is very lightweight (which means stiff cords sometimes lift it so it doesn't sit flat) and has a cheap feeling plastic housing with no mounting provision if you wanted to attach it to something, but these are minor complaints as it works well enough.It appears you can power the switch with micro USB if your devices require a lot of power (if you were wanting to charge something via USB for example), but even with the backlit keyboard I am using, I do not have this switch connected to power, and it and my devices work just fine.Overall I am happy with the UGREEN USB 3.0 switch.  If it were able to always make a connection with a computer that is asleep when switched to, I would be even happier, but that may not even be the fault of the switch.  I definitely recommend this if you are looking to share inputs between two computers without having to plug and unplug cords, dongles and adapters.",
        "I've wasted sooo much money trying to get a KVM switch for HDMI (or DP) that actually works. My monitor has three switchable inputs, so I'm using a USB switcher in combo with the monitor's ability to switch which computer is displayed. Guess what? The first USB switch I bought was junk as well. Frustrating, so I got this one to try, and it works. Been using it about a week now and it has not lost the connection a single time yet. The build quality is far short of the one it is replacing, which had a sturdy metal housing and a digital LED display to tell which is the current computer, but that one lost the connection constantly. This one has a small blue LED that jumps from one spot to another to to tell which one is active, and a small button to activate it located on the top of the unit. Also this one is plastic, and it weighs a fraction of what the other one did. And as far as gaming goes, when the old USB switcher would lose the connection, it would cause my game to hang, so it had to go, even though I loved the solid build quality and the user friendly layout and display. I have not tested data transfer speeds with this unit yet, but it has three USB 3 ports, so it should be as fast as a powered hub, it has a micro USB port to add power but the cable is not included. So I'm not rating this high on build quality, or ease of use, simply because it actually works very well for its intended purpose.",
        "This has allowed me to hook up my work laptop and personal pc tower to dual monitors, keyboard, and mouse. It works really well. All I have to do is switch inputs on my monitors. I have had a few minor issues at times with keyboard input. The adapter every once in a while acts like there is no keyboard connected for a few seconds. It then detects it and has no issues. I have been using this for about 6 months. I have been able to use this while gaming and have not experienced any noticeable input lag. Definitely recommend."

        "I absolutely love the scroll wheel on the G502x and I wish more companies would adopt something similar, but I ultimately went with the Spatha because it's simply so much more comfortable. This is one of the few mice that has a ring finger rest which I find absolutely essential. It's comfortable and has all the thumb buttons I need.The only complaint I have is that it is a bit heavy which is unfavorable for fps games which I prefer, and the scroll wheel encoder is a standard type that feels spongy will inevitably wear out. At least they made it easy to take the mouse apart and fix when the time comes.It's definitely the most expensive mouse I've ever bought so I hope it lasts. Seems to be built like a brick which is good.",
        "I've been using my Logitech G600 for years. It's my standard that I compare all other mice to.The armory crate software can be a little frustrating, I'm not going to lie. I had to install it, uninstall it, install it again and bypass an error to get it working. The customization on the lighting is a little lackluster, but it's not why I'm here.I like it a lot. There are fewer buttons than other MMO mice have, but honestly, I don't use all the buttons on my G600, so that's fine. I like a nice, big mouse. I like a mouse I can wrap my hand around, and this mouse fits my hand perfectly, pinkie and ring fingers included.The side buttons are nice and big, as well. The fact that there are fewer of them makes it easier for me to press them individually, because they're so much bigger to compensate.With a little more customization in the AC software, this could absolutely become my go to mouse.",

        "I am using this mouse primarily for gaming, so features like sensitivity control, comfort and latency are important for me.This mouse does all of these well. In fact, I think it would be easier for everyone if I just list the few minor things I don't like:The texture on the right side of the mouse irritated my pinky a bit, but I either got used to it or started holding my pinky differently so I do not really notice anymore.The \"rapid fire\" button only does three click bursts. I cannot even find a way to change this in the reddragon software -- you can change the function of the button, but the rapid fire can only be done in a 3 click (or shot, in an FPS) burst. You can even change things like the speed of the burst, but not just have it go full auto clicking when held down. I would often use this button for example in games where I am managing an inventory to rapidly sell large quantities of items -- I now have to click (although only 1/3 as much as I normally would), but this still gets annoying if I am trying to dump say 100 things. My old mouse with true rapid fire would drain stuff in a second.****The downloadable software is pretty nice. You can map any button to any function and control the LED colors and patterns. The mouse stores 5 DPI settings that you can customize both in DPI scale and the color that it illuminates the mouse wheel.I was really worried about latency too, but there is no perceptible latency for me when using it wirelessly. I as a disclaimer, I do have my PC and the wireless dongle only about 3 feet from the mouse at any given time, but so far it has seemed effectively instant to me.I also have large (specifically wide) hands and this is still pretty comfortable. No more soreness than any other gaming mouse I have used after long use.I have not truly tested battery life but after a full charge, I used the mouse for about 8-9 hours in eco mode (RBG off) and was showing 90% battery life in the app.All in all, this seems to be a great mouse by any standard, let alone at the price point of $30-40. I do not think a more expensive mouse would increase my gaming experience in any way. I have only had the mouse for a few days though, so the only thing to worry about is its longevity. If the mouse stops working or acting weird, I will update this review accordingly.Edit 4/18/24: just wanted to add a positive comment about battery life. I have been using the mouse for about a month in ecomode. I use it nearly everyday for 3-4 hours and am just now charging it for the second time (the software says it is at 40%). That's definitely better than I expected when I purchased. It's USB-c so you can use whatever USB-C cable you want, and it does not have to be the one included. It will still function wirelessly while being charged. Bringing this up because I used a wireless mouse once that would shut off when charging and the only way to use it was to plug it directly into the computer while charging -- this one can be used with any power source. Very happy with that",
        "I know a lot of people pass on this brand just because they're a \"budget\" brand (including myself)But I've heard nothing but good things about them so I decided to try one out and I'm really surprised.I'd say these are some of the best mice in this price range. You get a good amount of features you'd find on the premium gaming mice. It feels good in the hand, glides good, works on random surfaces without a  mouse pad and it looks pretty cool.Battery life is also really good, it sleeps when inactive after 1 min or so (maybe less) you'll get a lot of use out of one charge.The only con is that it feels a bit small to me and I dont have super long fingers or anythingnot a deal breaker but might be for others.Over all it's still an awesome mouse and I'd suggest it to anyone that doesn't want to spend $150 for a gaming mouse",
        "I recently had to bid farewell to my trusty Redragon Vampire Elite mouse, and after a moment of silence, I welcomed the Redragon M991 Gaming Mouse into my life. Let me tell you, it's been quite the upgrade! As an artist who adores vibrant colors, the RGB lighting on this mouse is a dream come true. It’s like having a mini disco party at my desk every day! The colors are not overly flashy, just enough to keep things interesting and make my workspace a bit more fun.Setting up the M991 was a breeze—just plug in the dongle, and you’re ready to play. The mouse comes in a beautifully packaged box, making it an excellent gift choice. Seriously, if you want to impress someone without breaking the bank, this is the mouse to get. The packaging alone makes it look like you spent a fortune.Enjoy the pictures, my goodness, I took the picture and when I uploaded it I saw how dirty it looked, so I cleaned it and added another one, there you go. I have had this mouse for two months, it is worked hard, all day every day, so far, no issues, still working great.Performance-wise, this mouse is no slouch. With 19,000 DPI, nine programmable buttons, and a rapid fire key, it’s perfect for both gaming and detailed design work. The buttons have a satisfying click without being too stiff, making it ideal for long sessions. Plus, the ergonomic design ensures comfort, even during intense gaming marathons or long hours of work. All in all, the Redragon M991 has brought a delightful splash of color and efficiency back to my desktop. Highly recommend!"

        "This is a really good keyboard for a mechanical keyboard. Don't let the price fool you. Yes, it's a cheap price but in no way is it a cheap quality product. It's low cost for as described below.  I purchased the RED switch version and the BROWN switch version because I could not make up mind (at first).  I've already tried a Blue switch.BLUE Switch = Clicky tactile feel. Loud like an old typewriter. Nice still, if you like that. I thought I would stick with Blue until...RED Switch = Very smooth linear feel no clicky. It is more thump, thump.  Sounds solid.  (this became my favorite)BROWN Switch = Is like an in-between a Blue and Red where it has some clicky but with a more linear smooth thump like the RED.  Very good and thought this was going to be my default but ended up preferring the RED mostly.All of the above are all great options it is just a matter of personal preference.  There are no wrong choices.The keyboard base : is very well built with some heft to it.  Feels like a 1970's Japanese old quality plastic on the base that they used to make old computers with.  It is a 60% keyboard size Ten-keyless which is about as small as you can get.The keys : are very nice and very well spaced.  The letters are clear and the feel is very good. The keycaps are removable with a provided tool.  The switches are NOT hot-swappable.Lighting :  is only ONE color - a cyan blue.  It is sharp and bright and the color looks very good.  Each key is lit up by the lighting with no shadowing.  You can adjust the brightness (I keep mine on high) and you change the light effect/pattern if you want from a few key combinations.  I keep mine on the default.The Cable : it is USB-C on one end and USB-A on the other end that plugs into your PC.  The cable length is very good but I still used a USB-A extension cable because my computer is further away from my desk.A few reasons for the low price is: It is not a high end name-brand, the switches are not hot-swappable, it is a wired keyboard but most mechanical keyboards are anyway, the lighting is one color, no software, etc.  If all you want is a very good mechanical keyboard minus some options or you just want to find out what you like and don't like.  This keyboard is great.  I really don't care about hot-swapping my switches (yet) but someday I will get there.  For now this works for me.",
        "The DIERYA T68SE 60% Gaming Mechanical Keyboard with Red Switches is designed for gamers seeking a compact yet responsive keyboard. Here’s a breakdown of its features and performance:Design:Compact Size (60% Layout): The keyboard features a minimalist design, omitting the numpad, function row, and other extraneous keys to save space and maintain portability.Build Quality: Constructed with durability in mind, typically with a solid build that withstands gaming sessions and regular use.Switches:Red Switches: Known for their linear and smooth keystrokes, Red switches are favored by gamers for quick actuation and responsiveness. They lack the tactile bump and audible click of other switch types, which can be either a pro or con depending on personal preference.Features:Anti-Ghosting Keys: Ensures that every keystroke is registered accurately, crucial for gaming where multiple key presses are common.Backlighting: Provides visual appeal and helps in low-light environments, though specific details on the lighting features (RGB, single color, etc.) weren’t specified in your description.Compatibility:Platform: Designed for Windows laptops and PCs, ensuring compatibility with most gaming setups. Compatibility with other operating systems like macOS might vary.User Experience:Typing Experience: Red switches offer a smooth typing experience suitable for gaming, though users who prefer tactile feedback might find them less satisfying.Portability: Its compact size makes it easy to carry and use in various environments, ideal for gamers who attend LAN parties or travel frequently.Summary:The DIERYA T68SE 60% Gaming Mechanical Keyboard with Red Switches appears to be a solid choice for gamers looking for a compact, responsive keyboard without compromising on performance. Its red switches and anti-ghosting keys cater specifically to gaming needs, while the compact size enhances portability. However, for those who prefer tactile feedback or additional features like RGB lighting, it might be worth exploring other options.Overall, if you prioritize a compact design and smooth key actuation for gaming, the DIERYA T68SE is likely to meet your expectations.",
        "Bought this keyboard about 3 weeks ago now and it has been great. Keys are very responsive and really like the quality of it. It feels solid for now little it cost. The light on it are nice and bright, you can dim them to your liking. They aren't the silent red keys they do make some noise but it isn't loud or annoying like the tactical or clicky keyboards. Would recommend for gaming, or even for a regular keyboard too."

        "It looks as good as it works. very responsive keys and buttons, nice led lights. overall a good option for a budget gaming build or just an upgrade to your every day kind of keyboard and mouse.",
        "For less than $40, this keyboard and mouse will get the job done. The keyboard feels high quality for it's low price tag. The colors also look really nice and bright.The keyboard/mouse is super easy to install, just plug it into your device and it's done. No extra software or drivers needed.The keyboard preforms well, the buttons feel nice to press and have that good click sound. The mouse on the other hand has a slightly poorer performance. It feels significantly cheaper than the keyboard to the point where I stuck with my old mouse and just kept the keyboard.An overall good product for a good price. Though I'm not the biggest fan of the mouse, it's a good value for this price."

        "Did not have to power it, but it is easily delivering power to my webcam, razer kraken v3, razer naga trinity, and Logitech k845.Switches easily between PC and laptop. It is very small, hides easily, and the remote button is a lifesaver. It feels sturdy and took less than 5 mins to set up. It costs about the same as a mouse/keyboard combo and takes up way less space.",
        "works very reliably and has a compact and solid design. switches fast and does work at USB 3.1 speeds as advertised.The only small negatives are that it does not come with a power supply and that I wish it has LEDs indicating which port is active on the remote.",
        "I work from home and need to be able to control both my work PC and my personal PC. I have the desk space for both systems, but no real place for 2 full sized keyboards and 2 mice, it's much easier to be able to use one set of peripherals to control both systems. I would normally do this with software like Mouse Without Borders or Synergy but I do not have the ability to install on the work system, so that's out. I had an older UGREEN Switcher, the previous model to this that was USB 2.0 and I was using that to switch between both systems. That one worked.. somewhat, but it was buggy and unreliable. I took a gamble and tried this one instead.I am happy to say that this version suffers none of the issues of it's predecessor. I am able to switch between systems without issue and use one set of Peripherals to control both machines. I was able to tuck it away someplace inconspicuous and I use the included remote so that I just have a single button on the top of my desk that switches between work PC and the Personal System. This is a far easier solution then having to type all my work stuff on the Laptop keyboard.This device works exactly as advertised and for what you get, the price is also incredibly fair. If you have two systems and want to use one keyboard/mouse for both.. go with this device. The older USB 2.0 device is slightly cheaper but not worth it, this one works MUCH better. This is the one to get."

        "I was skeptical when I purchased this, as I took a chance on a sub-$50 wireless headset for computer gaming.  My fears were unfounded, however, as this headset ROCKS!  Ok, it's not perfect.  DO NOT use it for music, as it's not calibrated for that.  What it is calibrated for is discord voice chat (my gaming group says the on-board microphone sounds better than my usb Snoball one did) and PC gaming.  It's very boomy and bass-heavy, which works well for shooters and action games.  The battery life is excellent, it's very light and comfortable on my giant head, pairing is a snap, and the price knocks it up to 5-stars.  If you need a budget headset option, go with the Acer Nitro K2!",
        "These things are great for a $30 wireless headset; for Discord, and in-game FX I have no complaints for 12 hours of gaming a week. These get me through the entire weekend (12 hours) of gaming on one charge and should go weeks without charging at the rate I use them.Notes:- Lightweight- Comfortable for 6 hours at a time for me (depends on your head and ear shapes and sizes)- Gets loud enough that I can't hear my surroundings if desired.- Music and FX sound good for gaming (these are not the headphones for you if music reproduction is a priority)- The microphone is clear and easy to understand (Discord friend has the same headset)- Nice range for when you need to step away and don't want to miss the action.- Funny annoyed woman's voice saying \"USB Connected\" at first connect.If PC / Console and peripherals are a priority to you, and you have some disposable income, then look at the $100.00 range to take a step up in sound reproduction. But if you only occasionally need headphones, or are just strapped for cash, these are not junk and you should feel good knowing that you spent roughly the same price as lunch for two or three at McDonald's on these capable headphones that should give you a few good years of service.",

        "Here's the deal. I have windows 11 and windows 7.Windows 7 needed the power connected while it discovered my devices. Once the devices were discovered, it didn't need the power connected; however, my keyboard has a noticeable ~1 second delay when I stop typing then start typing again.It also really helped connecting to USB 3.0 not 3.1 interfaces (blue vs. red on my mobo).I have a razr usb mouse and a ps/2 keyboard w/ a ps/2 usb female mouse+keyboard adapter connected to my monitor's hub. There is a slight delay on the ps/2 keyboard, but that makes sense due to the way ps/2 keyboards operate.I have yet to try this w/ a usb keyboard. The mouse works fine. I did notice the remote isn't a real IR. I have velcro'd the remote to the side of my desk and when I switch usb profiles, it switches on the switch without the remote pointing at the device (or anywhere close; I can cover the \"ir\" and it will still switch to a different profile). My other remote controlled items (soundbar, video switch) use real IR and if the remote is not pointing at the device, nothing changes.CONCLUSION:It seems ok for my use case; however, delays in ps/2 and mouse w/ windows 7 seem annoying. I also had to power the device while win 7 was discovering my \"devices\" or it would fail to complete. Once it was completed, I could remove the power to the switch itself.The irony: I'm writing this on win11 and I get noticeable ps/2 delays when I stop typing.  :(",
        "Works great,  includes 4x 6ft cables.  I purchased 2x10ft,  and 1x15ft cable.  Just as a PSA here,  10ft cable s worked fine,  the 15 cable seems to be a tad too long(computer recognized the connection,  but the USB failed).  and I do have the switch powered.  I tried the 15ft in multiple computers, and failed in all 3.  Also,  it is a quality Cable Matters cable.  seems 15ft it just too far of a stretch.  Also tried 6ft, with a USB3 extension cable that I know works,  also failed.",

        "Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts! I've gotta tell you about this nifty little device I've bought not once, but twice - the TP-Link UB500 Bluetooth 5.0 adapter. This thing is a game changer, especially for us gamers.First off, the plug-and-play feature is a dream. Just pop it into your PC and you're ready to roll. No messing around with complicated setups or anything like that. It's a real time-saver.Now, let's talk specs. This adapter uses the latest Bluetooth 5.0 plus EDR technology and is backward compatible with Bluetooth V4.2/4.0/3.0/2.1/2.0/1.1. It's a tiny thing, weighing just 2 grams and measuring 0.58\"L x 0.27\"W x 0.74\"H. But don't let its size fool you - it packs a punch!I mainly use this adapter for my Xbox controller, and let me tell you, it's been a revelation. The connection is rock solid - no lag, no dropouts, nothing. It's like having a wired connection, but without the actual wire. Freedom!The adapter works with all sorts of devices - laptops, desktops, mice, keyboards, you name it. And it's backward compatible with older Bluetooth versions, so it's got all your devices covered.The speed and coverage are top-notch. They claim it's twice as fast and has four times the coverage of Bluetooth 4.0, and I believe it. My Xbox controller has never felt more responsive.The design is another big plus. It's so small and sleek, you can leave it in your USB port and forget it's even there. It doesn't get in the way of anything else.Just a heads up, though - it's not compatible with Mac, Linux, TV, or Windows 8, and it's for PC use only. But if you're a Windows user like me, it's all good.So, to wrap up, if you're in the market for a reliable, high-performance Bluetooth adapter for your Xbox controller (or any other device, really), you can't go wrong with the TP-Link UB500. It's got my seal of approval!",
        "I've gone through a number of generic off brand bluetooth adapters. Some with antennas that you'd think would increase range or whatnot but for some reason they are all terrible.But this thing for just $15 has worked near flawlessly since the moment I got it. Literally plug and play with both windows and linux. And its nice and low profile as well, making it an easy addition to any device.If you need to add bluetooth to a device, just get this, it's worth every penny.",
        "All you have to do is plug it into your pc or whatever and you've got bluetooth. My motherboard didn't come with bluetooth (or wifi) but i was able to add bluetooth for basically free."

        "I'm not much of a gamer anymore, but I go through mice like one because of Adobe Illustrator - the amount of clicks made and the need for decent DPI, its important to have a durable mouse. I got this after looking up what felt like hundreds of options on Amazon - it's was very painful urgh... But this caught my attention and after reading many reviews on OTHER mice, the reviews on this one seemed pretty good.So after a lot of debate I purchased this. It's sooooo beautiful, more than I thought. I got the blue, yellow, and white one because it reminded me of like mechs and stuff. I like it, and I love that I don't have to have the RGB on - but if I'm feeling flash I can.The DPI is actually really good. I have a SteelSeries that says it has higher DPI than this one and this I immediately feel a huge difference. The reason I say this is because I wasn't expecting it or paying attention - online specs seemed like a reasonable and even lower DPI but good enough, and I was getting it for being able to recharge the batteries, and it's looks. But when I first moved the mouse it was like woah, it really tracked so I just wasn't expecting that.Cannot attest to the battery life yet, but seems normal. I don't want to deplete it completely to prolong the battery life so every once in a while I charge it when I sleep. I feel like it's a safe bet and it's harmless - I have a USB port hub for it anyways so why not?The LEDs are very bright and vibrant - again wasn't expecting that. A lot of mice I went through back in my gaming days with WoW and I've never seen LEDs this bright. The logo glows or throbs, however you wanna say it which I also didn't expect. Not sure if there's a way to change that but I didn't bother because I like it - it's very pretty.Overall, for a budget or a \"I don't wanna spend a lot of money right now\" kind of mouse, this really hit the spot. Feels like a 90$ mouse in my hand with the weight, grip, smooth surface, and of course being able to recharge it. My SteelSeries kept eating up a TON of batteries and that's why I was in the market. Glad I took a chance, since I don't know anything about this company, and considering buying a black version for my new rig on the way.The ONLY THING, and I mean the ONLY thing I'm disappointed about is that there isn't a matching keyboard to these very awesome unique colors. Very hard to match a baby-blue, yellow, and white mouse - it's so awesome but it doesn't match anything LOL. A bit of an oversight on my part. So now it's my spare laptop mouse until I order the black one. If they had matching keyboards for different colors NOW WE'RE TALKING. But obviously nothing to do with their quality, just an innocent mention if they're listening! <3",
        "***update 08/31/2024*** after leaving this review, they reached out to me thru amazon and sent me a replacement mouse so I have updated it to 5 stars :)I loved this mouse until the dongle stopped working and eventually was misplaced. I've contacted DAREU for a replacement dongle, even if i had to pay, because it seems incredibly wasteful and frivolous to have to buy an entirely new mouse just because of the dongle.I was happy about this product until I needed to contact their customer service. After being ignored, I'm just going to purchase a mouse from a different company. Hopefully those of you who purchase this mouse won't need customer service! Otherwise a great mouse.",
        "I upgraded to this mouse from another mouse I found here on Amazon. This mouse is so much smoother than any others I've seen before, and comes with so many customizable settings for use and gameplay that I really appreciate! The rgb on this mouse is beautiful and so far hasn't glitched or failed me yet. I love the option to go wired or wireless with this mouse, as I tend to switch between the two depending on what I'm doing at my PC at the time. The design is nice and simple and I love that it came in pink to match my setup. The manual is very descriptive and covers everything you need to know about the mouse in a concise, easy-to-read manner. So far I love it. The DPI settings are evenly differentiated, and the scrolling options are standard, so they're easy to get used to! if you buy it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Definitely worth the price."

        "I purchased this switch back in October 2015 as I have been looking for a way to share my keyboard and mouse between my home desktop and my work laptop which sits on a docking station.  The setup was pretty simple to where i just plugged my mouse and keyboard USB cables into the hub and then ran each of the hubs long cables, one each, to my desktop and laptop.  The cables are even long enough that it allowed me to snake them around behind my desk so as that I did not have to run them through the front which is really nice to hide the desktop clutter.  The button at the end of another cable, which switches between the devices, then runs to a spot right next to my keyboard for easy switching which only takes a couple of seconds. But for the past 4 months that I have owned this I have not had any issues with this and works great.  Occasionally I will hit the button and it doesn't take but it is just a matter of hitting it again.  It is still faster then me physically swapping keyboards and mice.  The other issue is that you cannot tell which system the switch is currently pointed to.  I have overcome this as I have an old Logitech G15 Keyboard which is backlit and has a status screen.  I installed the Logitech Software which allows you to change what the display on the keyboard says(time, CPU Temp, etc.)  Since I am not allowed to install outside software on my work laptop the keyboard just defaults to the G15 logo on the status screen.  So I can tell if the switch is pointed to my desktop when I see the keyboard display show the time and will know that it is pointed to the work laptop when it just says G15.  Additionally having a backlit keyboard lets you know when the hub has actually switched as when it powers on you know the connection should be working.  Again would be nice for the button to display something but this works too.PROS1. Easy setup2. Long Cables make it easier to hide other then other KVMs I have tried in the past3. Simple button press to switch which can be placed in a convenient location from the hub which also allows me to hide the hub4. Quick changing5. Doesn't Require software like some other switches6. Small hub which makes it easy to hideCONS1. Occasionally doesn't switch(though you just need to press it again if it doesn't take)2. No way to identify which system the hub is currently directed to(maybe two LEDs with a label next to each shwing A or B or even jsut coloring coding an LED Green is A, Blue is B)Thanks IOGEAR this was exactly what I was looking for!",
        "Effortless USB Sharing (4/5):If you have multiple computers and a limited number of USB devices, this switching hub is a handy solution. It allows you to seamlessly share up to four USB devices between two PCs with a simple press of a button. No more unplugging and plugging in devices when switching between computers.Easy Setup (4/5):Setting up the IOGEAR USB switching hub is straightforward. It's a plug-and-play device, and the included instructions are clear and easy to follow. You'll have it up and running in no time.Reliable Performance (4/5):The hub provides reliable performance, and I haven't experienced any issues with device connectivity or data transfer speeds. It effectively handles data transfer rates of up to 480Mbps, which is more than sufficient for most peripherals.Compact Design (4/5):The compact and lightweight design of the hub is practical for desktop or mobile use. It doesn't take up much space, making it an ideal solution for small workspaces or when you're on the go.Cost-Effective (4/5):Considering the convenience it offers in simplifying USB device sharing, the IOGEAR switching hub is reasonably priced. It saves you the hassle of purchasing duplicate peripherals for each computer, ultimately saving you money.",
        "Works very well. Allows me to have a single keyboard mouse that I use for two computers at my desk, and to easily switch back and forth. The reason I don't give five stars (and this may be for a reason beyond this device in question and something else entirely, so I only took away one star), is that one of the computers will get stuck in the startup process if this device is plugged into that computer AND that computer is selected. The other computer works perfectly fine (both are Windows 7 PCs; the problem PC was purchased late 2009, so it's older). However, if I make sure the first PC is selected (the one that starts up fine), then the second PC upon startup will come to a screen saying that no keyboard is detected and get stuck there (and I can't switch over at that time because it doesn't recognize the keyboard until Windows starts up for some reason).I went into the BIOS and tried to change the start up order and made sure the PC would look to the hard drive before looking for external device to boot up and that did not fix the problem (since I thought maybe the PC saw the USB switch as device to boot up from for some reason). I'm using a wireless mouse/keyboard combo (both communicate with the same base station that plugs into the USB device). This is the same wireless mouse and keyboard I've had for a long time, and it had worked on this PC for years without problem.To fix the problem, I took an old wired keyboard, plugged it into the problematic PC, and left it sitting under the desk with the PCs (tucked out of the way). Now, the problematic PC can start up perfectly fine as long as the first PC is selected (it still freezes up during start up if I have that PC selected).I definitely prefer this system to my old arrangement (which involved two keyboards and mouse on the desk simultaneously), and I still think it was worth the purchase (and the price was reasonable). However, it's not perfect. But given the fact that my issue was on an old PC (and there was a workaround) and the other PC had no problem at all, this may not be an issue at all for other users."

        "I've only been using this for about a week, but so far, it's been working great with my Macs.  I was using a USB 2.0 four-computer switch for years, but now that my computers are all USB 3.0, I wanted to upgrade.  I'd like to have a three-computer switch, but this is nice and compact, and the price of about $20 was in the sweet spot for me.As others have noted, it comes with two USB 3.0 cables to connect your computers to it.  Also, it is pretty lightweight, so it'll move around unless you secure it somehow.  I just used a single piece of double sided tape to stick it down to my USB 3.0 hub (which is what this is connected to), and that seems to be working great.I really (really) like that the lights on the front that indicate which computer is active are not bright.  I can easily see which is active, but I don't need to put something over the top of the light to keep myself from being blinded.Switching between computers is very easy with the push of a button.Construction seems really good.  I've purchased other Sabrent products.  Some have been home runs, and some have been duds.  This one seems like a good one.Some reviewers have noted issues with their Windows machines, but I've only used Macs so far, so I can't speak to that.All in all, this was a really nice update for me.",
        "Switch functionality works as expected. Small enough to hide behind my TV",
        "First, I am only using 1080p, so cannot speak for any higher resolution. But seems just fine at mine.Second, I have only tested 2 inputs into one output (my TV), not the other way around.Things I like:1. It works!2. The metal build (vs plastic) seems sturdy and good.3. I love that it does not require a power brick.4. It has a low price. I paid $10 on an Amazon deal.Things I don't like:1. The LED. A bit of black electrical tape deals with that. (I do the same with the lights on my router.)Things that you might like or not:1. There is no remote control. I don't need/want it so it is fine with me. I also think this is one reason why a power brick is NOT NEEDED. A worthy trade-off.I will want to get a much shorter male-male HDMI cord as I only have a 6 foot one to use now and it is way too long. Not a problem from the switch or maker. Just a function of my own setup."

        "I am not a gamer, so cannot speak for the appropriateness of this product for that use. I bought this to replace a Logitech MK530 whose letters had rubbed off over time to the point that even for my adequate touch typing skills, it was inconvenient at times, especially working at night in my home office where I usually have dimmer, indirect lighting. Having become used to (or spoiled) by backlit keyboards on my Surface Pro 3 and other laptops, I had decided that this was a feature I would like in a replacement keyboard.With that in mind, I first looked at Logitech's offerings since I already had a unified receiver that I had been using with my old keyboard and trackball. Unfortunately, I didn't really find anything that particularly struck me that wasn't huge like their wave keyboards (which are very good, by the way, but too big for this particular space). Since the keyboard would be used in close proximity to my Surface Dock, I expanded my search to include wired keyboards, of which there were scores to consider. I did not want a mechanical keyboard as I find the clicking annoying, especially late at night with others sleeping in adjoining rooms, so ruled those out early on. After reading countless reviews both here and on other sites, I settled on this one as it seemed to offer the best combination of typing experience, lighting control (OK, big cool factor) and size for my needs.I was very happily not disappointed. Typing is a joy on this keyboard. The keys are responsive, with good travel, and it has my preferred straight Enter key rather than the larger upside-down L shape preferred by some manufacturers. For me the advantage there is that all my other keyboards have the straight Enter Key and larger right shift key, so there was no awkward relearning curve, or challenges with switching between keyboards, which I do frequently with my own and clients' different devices. I also liked the fact that unlike most gaming keyboards, this did not have the extra bold W A S D key letters, which I simply found aesthetically unpleasing.This keyboard has six programmable keys in a vertical column to the left of the main keyboard section. While these were primarily intended for gamers, they are also very useful in a more traditional office environment to create quick access to specific programs or functions. For me, I used one to replace the Calculator shortcut on my Logitech keyboard, then used others to summon my most-used programs like Excel, Word and my Epson scanner. They work very well for that, but the downside is retraining my left hand that the far upper left key is NOT Esc, nor is the far lower left key Ctrl. Other than that minor inconvenience, the programmable keys add an extra level of customization and efficiency that is quite welcome. My one suggestion here to Corsair is that they create a software program to make customizing these programmable keys easier for the less technical user. I had to research this online and found that creating shortcuts to start programs with these macro keys is somewhat of a roundabout process. In essence, you need to create a shortcut for the program you wish to launch, assign it a shortcut key combination, then record a macro of that shortcut to the key you want to assign. Not exactly the most straight-forward way of doing things, but it does the job. There's an opportunity for Corsair or an enterprising programmer here.The backlit lighting control is superb and quite extensive. Essentially you have three lighting zones, each of which can display up to seven different colors. There are quite a few pre-programmed choices, both for color and fading effects, as well as the ability to customize to your heart's content. If you are so inclined, you can quite literally spend 30-40 minutes or longer playing around with the different lighting combinations and probably still not exhaust all the possibilities. Take some time and have fun with this. It is definitely at the upper end on the coolness scale.One (for me) con, was the size of the lettering on the movement keys in between the main alpha keyboard and the number pad. In the interest of continuing their pseudo future looking typeface, which apparently assumes that pseudo future users have perfect eyesight, the lettering on these keys is uncomfortably small for my sixty-something year-old eyes. This should be a relatively easy fix for Corsair to implement, and would also make those keys more visible to gamers as well.Overall, this is a wonderful keyboard at a reasonable price, that will serve well for all but perhaps the most selective of gamers, and is an excellent replacement for mainstream users who desire something a little beyond the ho-hum run-of-the-mill basic keyboard, The typing experience is easily one of the best I've found in over three decades of computer work.",
        "My favorite, most used keyboard in my office is my Das 4 Professional Soft Tactile MX Brown Mechanical Keyboard. I mention this so that you could have an idea as to what I look for in a keyboard. Although Das does make an illuminated keyboard, Das Keyboard Prime 13 White LED Backlit, at $129.00 it’s a bit too steep for most of us. I wanted an illuminated keyboard for home use so I could use it at night without disturbing anyone by having to keep the overhead lights on.I ended up buying 4 keyboards looking for the one that not only had good backlighting but also good typing action making it easy to see at night and easy to type on. I wanted to keep the price to around $50.00 – so here is what I bought in order:Perixx PX-1100 ($59.99)The keyboard has serious flaws that significantly interfere with it's stated purpose. It is supposed to be illuminated so that it could be used in a dark room. It specifically states that it has key and letter illumination which it does but here lies the problem - the illumination is very uneven with some keys being very bright and others just an inch or two away being very dim. As an example, the left arrow key on my keyboard was very bright while the right arrow key was barely visible especially since the keys next to it were so bright! Another factor is the brightness surrounding the keys which in some areas is brighter than the keys themselves which makes it more difficult to read them. This keyboard apparently has \"zone illumination\" meaning that it has just a few LED's lighting up the keys and in some places, near the edge of the zones, there are dim areas - very dim areas, even with the brightness at maximum. If you're buying this for the illumination to make it easier to read in a dark room, look elsewhere. If you want a cool looking, colorful keyboard that has relatively good good typing action this is your keyboard, it is heavy, well built, has good typing action and poor lighting. This was the first one I bought and I was very disappointed with it, hence the mediocre rating.Azio – Vision Large Font Keyboard ($29.99)This keyboard has large font: letters, numbers and symbols making it very easy to read in a darkened room. The lighting is even throughout the entire keyboard, there are no bright or dark areas and you can easily change the color of the keys for the entire keyboard or within the 5 lighting zones. For people with vision impairments, this is your keyboard. It is easy to use, set-up and change colors. The typing action on it is very unsatisfying for me as the keys are larger than standard keys so my fingers are not used to the spacing. Also, the height of the keys is somewhat shallower than standard keys and the resistance when you type is “mushy” at least for me. That said, for visually impaired people who are used to the common $15 to $20 keyboard this will be fine for you and at $30, it is a bargain.Logitech K740 – Fullsize Illuminated Slim Keyboard ($59.99)This keyboard is very slim in fact, the travel of the keys when you type is minimal and they are very shallow which I am not used to so I found typing on it unsatisfying. The keyboard reminds me of the one on my inexpensive, compact laptop which gets the job done when I’m traveling but is not designed for serious typing. The illumination however is excellent, bright white and very legible. Set-up is simple and adjusting the brightness is straight forward. If my “go-to” keyboard wasn’t so good, I probably wouldn’t have an issue with this one. Once you have typed on a quality keyboard with mechanical switches you get spoiled! At $60 on sale, I was underwhelmed.Corsair K55 Gaming Keyboard ($47.99)This keyboard basically met my expectations for typing feedback and illumination for the price but it’s far from perfect. When you first connect it to your computer you will be met with an over the top moving display of colors flowing across the entire keyboard which is very distracting and thankfully easily changed with just a few key strokes. You can make it all one color if you wish and choose the color you want or make each zone a different color. The keyboard is light weight like most cheap keyboards, lighter even than the non-illuminated Dell keyboard that it replaced but it gets the job done. The first thing I noticed is that the illumination is crisp and even throughout the keyboard. The letters and symbols are centered on the keys and a bit bolder in font than average keyboards. The keys are not individually illuminated but there are enough LED’s to give it an even appearance. The lighting around the keys is somewhat bright but not to the point of making them difficult to read as on the Perixx. Although the keys themselves are not mechanical, they feel somewhat mechanical giving it a nice tactile experience. The keys have the same height as one would find on a good standard keyboard and have about the same travel as well, so it is a good keyboard to type on or use for gaming or both!There are many illuminated keyboards out there and I spent hours shopping on Amazon and reading reviews trying to finds one that would be right for me. For some people, the typing action may be secondary and so for them, the best buy would be the Azio Vision Large Font Keyboard which at $29.99 is a bargain. It is the easiest by far to read under any conditions and very easy to use/set-up. The Logitech at $60 is also very easy to read but it is twice the price of the Azio. That said, the keys are standard size and it is very well made. For me, the Corsair K55 was the best compromise; although the Azio and the Logitech are easier to read, the Corsair is also easy to read, they are just a bit better in visibility but when I considered typing feel and speed , the Corsair wins.I hope this helps some of you make the right buying decision.Art",
        "Haven't used semi quiet keys since Highschool... This Corsair keyboard has served me well since my Razer BW Chroma met its demise! The Keys are perfect for gaming and are fairly quiet! The media buttons work great, and the wrist rest is awesome!"

        "I've been using the Razer Naga V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse for a few months now, and it's a versatile piece of equipment with some standout features and a few drawbacks.Pros:Customization: The interchangeable side plates with 2, 6, and 12-button configurations are fantastic. You can switch between them depending on your gaming needs, which is incredibly convenient. I sometimes like to play league and other times play CS2, so having the ability to change it at a moment's notice is amazing.Performance: The mouse performs exceptionally well, with a smooth and responsive feel. The upgraded Focus Pro 30K optical sensor and third-gen optical switches provide precise tracking and quick response times. I bought the wireless dock as well and it charges the mouse fast and allows me to use it wirelessly for at least a week of use. Gonna make a separate review for that though.Comfort: The ergonomic design is comfortable for long gaming sessions. The right-handed shape and finger rest make it easy to use without causing hand fatigue. It is lighter than a CORSAIR Scimitar which in my opinion is the best reason to get this over that.Wireless Connectivity: The wireless connection is stable, and the mouse offers both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth options. The battery life is impressive, lasting up to 150 hours over 2.4GHz and up to 300 hours over Bluetooth.Cons:Price: The Razer Naga V2 Pro is on the pricier side, coming in at around $179.99. While the features justify the cost, it might be a significant investment for some gamers.Weight: The mouse is a bit heavier than some other gaming mice, which might not be ideal for those who prefer a lighter feel. Again, I say heavier in comparison to a Deathadder. It is heavier, but still light for the type of mouse it is.Software Compatibility: The customization software is only compatible with Windows, which could be a limitation for Mac users.Overall, the Razer Naga V2 Pro is a top-tier gaming mouse that offers excellent customization, performance, and comfort. It's a great choice for gamers who need a versatile and high-performing mouse, but be prepared to invest a bit more and consider the weight and software compatibility.",

The functionally of the mouse is that you can play any game with key binds of your choosing with its detachable side panel suitable for any games ranging from MOBA RTS FPS and more.The comfort of the mouse is 9/10, nothing too special or degrading, it can be a bit large for small hands but will be perfect for most people. The design of the mouse is slick, smooth and can almost qualify as a decorative stand if your into it. It has a very high quality made body with beautiful RGB that can be changed in the razer software.Responsiveness of the mouse is less than a few miceoseconss on its wireless mode and wired, to keep a long story short, it's so fast that you'll not notice any latency at allIt can be a bit hard to use at first, getting used to the software that is used to program the side panels and finding which side panel fit your choice of games, but once you get used to it, you'll know that is \"click for effect\"",
        "First off, the Synapse software is garbage. Just not reliable aside from simple assignments. But I was able to re-map the dpi buttons and left and right scroll wheel tilt buttons. If you’re on a Mac, just assign them to letters and use Karabiner to handle the assignments. Works great. I couldn’t use hypershift because it was just not getting set up in Synapse reliably (I actually returned my first one because I thought it was broken but Razer just told me that it’s a software issue). But you can use Karabiner to do what hypershift does and more.Pros: Was also looking at the Corsair Scimitar but this was on sale first. And 19 buttons is better than 16. Also, love that it still uses a AA battery. Just think it will last longer. The Scimitar does allow you to use it as a wired mouse and that’s cool. And it has native Mac support. But I think if you don’t mind putting in the effort, Karabiner works better.Cons: The two buttons on the left mouse button are an ergonomic nightmare. But better to have them than not. And if you haven’t used an MMO mouse before, it takes some getting used to. Probably definitely not for FPS gamers. I use it for coding and general productivity and works great but it does require learning a gentle touch because your fingers are basically on a button at all times (except for your pinky).Anyway, hopefully it lasts. But definitely would buy again."

        "A nice little monitor. Good resolution and functionality.",
        "I am an electronics engineer by profession. I spend my days troubleshooting and repairing advanced electronics including computers, computer systems, power supplies, etc.I am also a ham radio guy and have built many ham radio projects over the years. I bought this product thinking to use it for my Raspberry Pi (4) that I use for various ham radio projects and how nice it would be to have a small, inexpensive display screen on my ham bench.1. It is a good size for looking at some screens that I use in my ham radio use.2.It is a small screen in that without a keyboard and mouse you are not going to find it very useful as a touch screen monitor unless you have small fingers. Unfortunately I ahve size 10 fingers and this screen is much happier with size 6 fingers .... so beware of this issue. I also find my iPhone  bit difficult to use in the touch mode .... maybe the term hamfisted is just right for me?3. The instruction for getting this unit up & running are , well, useless unless you know Chinese ...the english version is jut pictures and diagrams that leave some to be desired for clarity.4.DO NOT mount the pi board to the back of the screen as the heat it gives off is in my opinion just too much. Besides, you risk damaging you pi by being hamfisted like me. I did get my pi fixed and put it back into the original case and just connected the darn thing on the bench.5. I would have given it a much higher rating but felt that it was not as good a product as I expected. That being the case I am certain that others will of coruse disagree with me and that's ok.6. The company was very quick to shipp this item, it was very well packaged and I don't believe that there will be any problems using it in the ham shack. I just have to figure out cable routing and keeping the work desk clean.7. The visuals and color for it is absolutely top notch and I am satified with my purchase, the cables that come with it are not the best for my needs but that is a minor issue as the wones that work for me are easy to get.8. I have some other ham radio projects in design stage that this monitor will be perfect for and plan to buy more for that use .... no regrets on this purchase.Added more ifo: Here are some photos of how I ended up with the unit soa fer. It's just a temporary set up and one that will be needing modificatio to be useful on my crowded ham bench.I am definately going to add the bluetooth keayboard & mouse. Got to rid myself of the infernal cables ... they really detract from the goodness of this display.Photo 1 shows the display with the front view on the bench.Photo 2 is from the rear with th pi computer attached to the back of the display by velcro tape.Note all the cabling and teh mess it presents. Installing a wireless keyboard and mouse will clear up a lot of that wireing, and I'll try to make whats left cleaned up better.The finall installation will set on the upper shelf of my bench and the only use for it will be using my ham radio software for rig control and digital operations.",

        "This is a nice little switch that does its job very well. I use it to switch keyboard and webcam between the work laptop and a personal desktop computer. For my work laptop I use a docking station and one output of the switch feeds into the docking station. It has no issues with that set up. With 4 USB input ports, I could plug additional devices into it (as opposed to running all cables all the way to the desktop). That way it also acts as a multi-USB port. I have plugged in windows hello fingerprint sensor in it too. Works flawlessly. A small issue with it is that the light on the device (indicating the switch position) is very dim and can only be seen if looked from the above. You cannot see it from the side. So it's not easy to know which position the switch is in. The physical switch is just a press switch so that doesn't tell if it's connecting device 1 or device 2. It's not a deal breaker for me. The switch is great other than that!",
        "Not much to say other than it works. If you just need a simple USB switch, this one works perfectly well so far. I work from home, so I use it to switch my keyboard and mouse between my work station and my personal computer, and so far it has been working perfectly.If I had to nitpick, the only extremely minor thing I could say is that there is a slight delay when switching, but I am talking about like a 2 second delay, nothing crazy. I used to have another USB switch that was pretty much instant, but it only had 1 USB port to split between 2 computers so I had to replace it with this switch since I went from a wireless keyboard to a wired one and needed at least 2 input ports.As far as accessories, it's nice that it includes some cables and a USB C adapter. They seem to work well too, so you are getting your money's worth. So if this switch has all the features you need, I'd definitely recommend it.",
        "It does what it is supposed to... I can now use one keyboard and mouse with a PC and a laptop.  But, sometimes its starts acting up.  Like, the power light on the keyboard will start blinking, and then I know its time for a reset.  Or the mouse stops responding...  But, I only have to do a reboot like every 4 or 5 days, so it isn't that bad.  I just wish someone could make one of these switches that is dependable.  I'll gladly pay more, but there don't seem to be any."

        "I received a G Cloud for Christmas in 2023, so I have had a concentrated week of seeing what the device can and cannot do.  Side-note (not factored into the score), the BRAND NEW unit sold by Amazon (not a 3rd party) turned out to be used.  The box seal had been opened, and even the screen protector was gone.  So I returned it and got another.  Second side-note, the first unit came with the wall charger, but the replacement did not (even though it is pictured in the manual).  I thought this was a mistake, but then found a slapped-on statement from Logitech saying they stopped including wall adapters for the good of the environment (yeah that gets a huge LOL, congrats on your cost-savings Logitech).  On to the real review ...I wanted the unit mostly to be able to stream games from my PS4 (in my living room) and Xbox Series X (upstairs in a racing / flying cab).  And long story short - this unit FINALLY delivers what I have been striving for since I tried using the PSP to connect to my PS3 many years ago (and then Vita, which was equally bad at streaming).  The Xbox streaming works great with the Xbox app.  The controllers work amazingly well.  The PS4 at first worked good enough to play, but the resolution varied and sometimes would get a little blocky.  I connected it to my router using a network cable, and that made the streaming become crystal clear.  Works great anywhere in my house.  To stream anywhere in the world requires port forwarding to be setup on the router, and so I am not going to pursue that.  Note that I am using a 3rd party app for the PS4 streaming so the Logitech controls are fully supported.  I will say I can detect a slight lag in the controls (probably less than a tenth of a second), which for a high-speed game (think racing) the experience is still playable but is slightly impacted.  But for my usage (Fallout 4 on PS4, Flight Simulator on Xbox) gameplay feels just fine and a very slight delay does not impact gaming.I am also using the unit as a retro-gaming handheld.  Gaming is fantastic for all consoles that are GameCube and earlier.  PS2 works great for some titles, but has some slowdown for others (but settings can be tweaked to be playable for just about anything).  For me, having a giant library of Advance titles, SNES, Genesis, and yeah even Atari is awesome.The ergonomics of the G Cloud is fantastic.  I have fairly large hands, and it is comfortable to play.  The screen at 7 inches doesn't sound big, but compared to my Switch Lite and older PS handhelds, the screen is a magical giant gift from the gods.  Resolution is a very sharp 1080P.  Touch works great, and so the hardware is quite impressive.  Battery life is outstanding.So the memory at 64GB is one weak point of the system.  There IS a microSD expansion, and I had to spend a couple of days to get everything working well.  Bottom line, I first tried a 512GB Sandisk card, and it did not work correctly, despite trying every formatting method out there.  Folks, 256GB is the max, trust me.  So a Sandisk 256GB works like a charm.  It will NOT work correctly if you extend the storage as part of the Android device.  It has to be formatted as external storage, and then it works great.The beauty of this device is that it is truly just an Android device with Google Play.  So the gaming options are almost unlimited.  And you can use it to watch movies, or control your thermostats, or whatever you use a normal Android device for.In summary, this is an amazing device and I could not be happier with it!",
        "All these reviews about this device being underpowered for emulating are really missing the point of this device. This is really a switch like controller that runs android so it can run remote play apps or cloud gaming apps (though much more comfortable to hold then a switch with better battery life.) if you want a device that can do emulation and full console gaming but portable you will definitely want to look elsewhere for something like a price subsidized steam deck, or Retroid device or any of the other smaller emulation designed devices would better suite you.I however was looking for a high quality, portable sturdy second screen with good controls  and good battery life which 12 hours is hard to beat. (Yes you can do with with an iphone / ipad or android phone / tablet but if you have tried that like i have you will find the screen size to be too small with thick black bars to make a 16:9 aspect ratio that is standard with TVs or for the case of tablets too large and now sitting on a table bluetoothed to a controller.) This device out of the box (at least for xbox, playstation requires a 3rd party app called PSPlay as the Sony official app doesn’t support the g clouds controllers yet (maybe with an update to Sony's app))  will take your console and make it portable just be sure to have wifi 5 (which is the wifi spec on the g cloud) or greater as this all requires a lot of local bandwidth on your personal wifi network.I found for the best results i had to hard wire my consoles over LAN and then to use my eero wifi 6 system as the final wireless step to the g cloud, i have had almost no artifacting, latency issues, or  ghosting since switching to this setup notice i didnt say none.. just 99% perfect streaming. Even with other traffic on my network like my partner streaming movies over apple tv etc. this setup performs almost perfectly enough to think its happening on device.I did initially try to use the PS4 pro and Xbox S on wifi, and while the xbox s’ modern wifi worked great, the ps4 pro’s was not good, downloading or updating software while trying to remote control the console would resort in artifacts and issues. I mostly blame Sony’s` wifi in the ps4 pro as even when it was connected to the tv i had issues with it.  The minute i put it on LAN all those issues went away and it was as if the G cloud was directly connected to the PS4 Pro i was able to crank up PSPlay’s streaming settings to max and the gaming became buttery smooth. Microsofts Xbox App does a lot of the work for you when it comes to remote play and is frankly superior to sony’s app and even the 3rd party PSPlay (which is an improvement on the official Sony one.) The xbox app  will automatically scale the graphics quality based on current wifi and other factors to smooth out the experience so, while not unusable as the ps4 pro was over wifi, it was just not a perfect experience but still playable! But, again for best results hardwire LAN to the xbox s and then wifi 6 to the g cloud for buttery smooth, full hd, no artifacting or noticeable lag while gaming.I did try some Xbox Cloud Gaming but found that to be sorta redundant as I have a console in my home but i guess the option is nice if you don't.. however the streaming was only ok in my opinion. I have fios fiberoptic gigabit internet with wifi 6 and i still had artifacting and some lag, while playable for non timing critical games definitely not a perfect or optimized experience. It just seems at this time that game streaming from servers outside the home is just not ready for prime time in my opinion.I think playing my consoles on g cloud is going to replace playing my consoles on my tv as I prefer the handheld form-factor and casualness of just picking up and playing like the switch but the graphics of the better consoles really pop on the 7” screen which is really the star of the show. The screen really is good for a LCD, the black levels are good, colors pop and it gets very bright! Hard to find something like this with this battery life.The android version on the device is basic but the addition of tablet mode means you can multitask (something you cant do in the “console ui”) The device software in its current revision lacks screen mapping of the controls so android games will run but wont take advantage of the extra hardware buttons and sticks (this is something that can be added with 3rd party software but as I only use this as a console portable screen I have not tried this, as all the software I use is designed for the controls or has control mapping) this is apparently  not good if you want to run games natively on the device but with its specs it wont really do a good job at that.This device really has been narrowly designed for streaming games and its processor does an amazing job at that for 12 hours but your milage playing game software locally will vary (not that i have tried just seen other reviewers attempts.)",
        "Casi nunca hago reviews, pero de verdad que este producto lo merece,  es lo mejor para hacer streaming , me encantó, hace mucho que no estaba tan contento con una compra, lo recomiendo ampliamente. Yo lo uso con Moonlight y Ps Play y cero lag , la pantalla está increíble, el peso está muy bien, ya puedo avanzar a mi super backlog donde sea ( si también en el baño), solo debes tener buena conexión de Internet. Si lo que buscas es transmitir tus juegos de play o PC cómprala ya, no te arrepentirás. ( también sirve desde xbox y otras apps como GFN)"

        "I am not a gamer, so cannot speak for the appropriateness of this product for that use. I bought this to replace a Logitech MK530 whose letters had rubbed off over time to the point that even for my adequate touch typing skills, it was inconvenient at times, especially working at night in my home office where I usually have dimmer, indirect lighting. Having become used to (or spoiled) by backlit keyboards on my Surface Pro 3 and other laptops, I had decided that this was a feature I would like in a replacement keyboard.With that in mind, I first looked at Logitech's offerings since I already had a unified receiver that I had been using with my old keyboard and trackball. Unfortunately, I didn't really find anything that particularly struck me that wasn't huge like their wave keyboards (which are very good, by the way, but too big for this particular space). Since the keyboard would be used in close proximity to my Surface Dock, I expanded my search to include wired keyboards, of which there were scores to consider. I did not want a mechanical keyboard as I find the clicking annoying, especially late at night with others sleeping in adjoining rooms, so ruled those out early on. After reading countless reviews both here and on other sites, I settled on this one as it seemed to offer the best combination of typing experience, lighting control (OK, big cool factor) and size for my needs.I was very happily not disappointed. Typing is a joy on this keyboard. The keys are responsive, with good travel, and it has my preferred straight Enter key rather than the larger upside-down L shape preferred by some manufacturers. For me the advantage there is that all my other keyboards have the straight Enter Key and larger right shift key, so there was no awkward relearning curve, or challenges with switching between keyboards, which I do frequently with my own and clients' different devices. I also liked the fact that unlike most gaming keyboards, this did not have the extra bold W A S D key letters, which I simply found aesthetically unpleasing.This keyboard has six programmable keys in a vertical column to the left of the main keyboard section. While these were primarily intended for gamers, they are also very useful in a more traditional office environment to create quick access to specific programs or functions. For me, I used one to replace the Calculator shortcut on my Logitech keyboard, then used others to summon my most-used programs like Excel, Word and my Epson scanner. They work very well for that, but the downside is retraining my left hand that the far upper left key is NOT Esc, nor is the far lower left key Ctrl. Other than that minor inconvenience, the programmable keys add an extra level of customization and efficiency that is quite welcome. My one suggestion here to Corsair is that they create a software program to make customizing these programmable keys easier for the less technical user. I had to research this online and found that creating shortcuts to start programs with these macro keys is somewhat of a roundabout process. In essence, you need to create a shortcut for the program you wish to launch, assign it a shortcut key combination, then record a macro of that shortcut to the key you want to assign. Not exactly the most straight-forward way of doing things, but it does the job. There's an opportunity for Corsair or an enterprising programmer here.The backlit lighting control is superb and quite extensive. Essentially you have three lighting zones, each of which can display up to seven different colors. There are quite a few pre-programmed choices, both for color and fading effects, as well as the ability to customize to your heart's content. If you are so inclined, you can quite literally spend 30-40 minutes or longer playing around with the different lighting combinations and probably still not exhaust all the possibilities. Take some time and have fun with this. It is definitely at the upper end on the coolness scale.One (for me) con, was the size of the lettering on the movement keys in between the main alpha keyboard and the number pad. In the interest of continuing their pseudo future looking typeface, which apparently assumes that pseudo future users have perfect eyesight, the lettering on these keys is uncomfortably small for my sixty-something year-old eyes. This should be a relatively easy fix for Corsair to implement, and would also make those keys more visible to gamers as well.Overall, this is a wonderful keyboard at a reasonable price, that will serve well for all but perhaps the most selective of gamers, and is an excellent replacement for mainstream users who desire something a little beyond the ho-hum run-of-the-mill basic keyboard, The typing experience is easily one of the best I've found in over three decades of computer work.",
        "My favorite, most used keyboard in my office is my Das 4 Professional Soft Tactile MX Brown Mechanical Keyboard. I mention this so that you could have an idea as to what I look for in a keyboard. Although Das does make an illuminated keyboard, Das Keyboard Prime 13 White LED Backlit, at $129.00 it’s a bit too steep for most of us. I wanted an illuminated keyboard for home use so I could use it at night without disturbing anyone by having to keep the overhead lights on.I ended up buying 4 keyboards looking for the one that not only had good backlighting but also good typing action making it easy to see at night and easy to type on. I wanted to keep the price to around $50.00 – so here is what I bought in order:Perixx PX-1100 ($59.99)The keyboard has serious flaws that significantly interfere with it's stated purpose. It is supposed to be illuminated so that it could be used in a dark room. It specifically states that it has key and letter illumination which it does but here lies the problem - the illumination is very uneven with some keys being very bright and others just an inch or two away being very dim. As an example, the left arrow key on my keyboard was very bright while the right arrow key was barely visible especially since the keys next to it were so bright! Another factor is the brightness surrounding the keys which in some areas is brighter than the keys themselves which makes it more difficult to read them. This keyboard apparently has \"zone illumination\" meaning that it has just a few LED's lighting up the keys and in some places, near the edge of the zones, there are dim areas - very dim areas, even with the brightness at maximum. If you're buying this for the illumination to make it easier to read in a dark room, look elsewhere. If you want a cool looking, colorful keyboard that has relatively good good typing action this is your keyboard, it is heavy, well built, has good typing action and poor lighting. This was the first one I bought and I was very disappointed with it, hence the mediocre rating.Azio – Vision Large Font Keyboard ($29.99)This keyboard has large font: letters, numbers and symbols making it very easy to read in a darkened room. The lighting is even throughout the entire keyboard, there are no bright or dark areas and you can easily change the color of the keys for the entire keyboard or within the 5 lighting zones. For people with vision impairments, this is your keyboard. It is easy to use, set-up and change colors. The typing action on it is very unsatisfying for me as the keys are larger than standard keys so my fingers are not used to the spacing. Also, the height of the keys is somewhat shallower than standard keys and the resistance when you type is “mushy” at least for me. That said, for visually impaired people who are used to the common $15 to $20 keyboard this will be fine for you and at $30, it is a bargain.Logitech K740 – Fullsize Illuminated Slim Keyboard ($59.99)This keyboard is very slim in fact, the travel of the keys when you type is minimal and they are very shallow which I am not used to so I found typing on it unsatisfying. The keyboard reminds me of the one on my inexpensive, compact laptop which gets the job done when I’m traveling but is not designed for serious typing. The illumination however is excellent, bright white and very legible. Set-up is simple and adjusting the brightness is straight forward. If my “go-to” keyboard wasn’t so good, I probably wouldn’t have an issue with this one. Once you have typed on a quality keyboard with mechanical switches you get spoiled! At $60 on sale, I was underwhelmed.Corsair K55 Gaming Keyboard ($47.99)This keyboard basically met my expectations for typing feedback and illumination for the price but it’s far from perfect. When you first connect it to your computer you will be met with an over the top moving display of colors flowing across the entire keyboard which is very distracting and thankfully easily changed with just a few key strokes. You can make it all one color if you wish and choose the color you want or make each zone a different color. The keyboard is light weight like most cheap keyboards, lighter even than the non-illuminated Dell keyboard that it replaced but it gets the job done. The first thing I noticed is that the illumination is crisp and even throughout the keyboard. The letters and symbols are centered on the keys and a bit bolder in font than average keyboards. The keys are not individually illuminated but there are enough LED’s to give it an even appearance. The lighting around the keys is somewhat bright but not to the point of making them difficult to read as on the Perixx. Although the keys themselves are not mechanical, they feel somewhat mechanical giving it a nice tactile experience. The keys have the same height as one would find on a good standard keyboard and have about the same travel as well, so it is a good keyboard to type on or use for gaming or both!There are many illuminated keyboards out there and I spent hours shopping on Amazon and reading reviews trying to finds one that would be right for me. For some people, the typing action may be secondary and so for them, the best buy would be the Azio Vision Large Font Keyboard which at $29.99 is a bargain. It is the easiest by far to read under any conditions and very easy to use/set-up. The Logitech at $60 is also very easy to read but it is twice the price of the Azio. That said, the keys are standard size and it is very well made. For me, the Corsair K55 was the best compromise; although the Azio and the Logitech are easier to read, the Corsair is also easy to read, they are just a bit better in visibility but when I considered typing feel and speed , the Corsair wins.I hope this helps some of you make the right buying decision.Art",
        "Haven't used semi quiet keys since Highschool... This Corsair keyboard has served me well since my Razer BW Chroma met its demise! The Keys are perfect for gaming and are fairly quiet! The media buttons work great, and the wrist rest is awesome!"

        "This is a nice little switch that does its job very well. I use it to switch keyboard and webcam between the work laptop and a personal desktop computer. For my work laptop I use a docking station and one output of the switch feeds into the docking station. It has no issues with that set up. With 4 USB input ports, I could plug additional devices into it (as opposed to running all cables all the way to the desktop). That way it also acts as a multi-USB port. I have plugged in windows hello fingerprint sensor in it too. Works flawlessly. A small issue with it is that the light on the device (indicating the switch position) is very dim and can only be seen if looked from the above. You cannot see it from the side. So it's not easy to know which position the switch is in. The physical switch is just a press switch so that doesn't tell if it's connecting device 1 or device 2. It's not a deal breaker for me. The switch is great other than that!",
        "Not much to say other than it works. If you just need a simple USB switch, this one works perfectly well so far. I work from home, so I use it to switch my keyboard and mouse between my work station and my personal computer, and so far it has been working perfectly.If I had to nitpick, the only extremely minor thing I could say is that there is a slight delay when switching, but I am talking about like a 2 second delay, nothing crazy. I used to have another USB switch that was pretty much instant, but it only had 1 USB port to split between 2 computers so I had to replace it with this switch since I went from a wireless keyboard to a wired one and needed at least 2 input ports.As far as accessories, it's nice that it includes some cables and a USB C adapter. They seem to work well too, so you are getting your money's worth. So if this switch has all the features you need, I'd definitely recommend it.",
        "It does what it is supposed to... I can now use one keyboard and mouse with a PC and a laptop.  But, sometimes its starts acting up.  Like, the power light on the keyboard will start blinking, and then I know its time for a reset.  Or the mouse stops responding...  But, I only have to do a reboot like every 4 or 5 days, so it isn't that bad.  I just wish someone could make one of these switches that is dependable.  I'll gladly pay more, but there don't seem to be any."

        "I'm not much of a gamer anymore, but I go through mice like one because of Adobe Illustrator - the amount of clicks made and the need for decent DPI, its important to have a durable mouse. I got this after looking up what felt like hundreds of options on Amazon - it's was very painful urgh... But this caught my attention and after reading many reviews on OTHER mice, the reviews on this one seemed pretty good.So after a lot of debate I purchased this. It's sooooo beautiful, more than I thought. I got the blue, yellow, and white one because it reminded me of like mechs and stuff. I like it, and I love that I don't have to have the RGB on - but if I'm feeling flash I can.The DPI is actually really good. I have a SteelSeries that says it has higher DPI than this one and this I immediately feel a huge difference. The reason I say this is because I wasn't expecting it or paying attention - online specs seemed like a reasonable and even lower DPI but good enough, and I was getting it for being able to recharge the batteries, and it's looks. But when I first moved the mouse it was like woah, it really tracked so I just wasn't expecting that.Cannot attest to the battery life yet, but seems normal. I don't want to deplete it completely to prolong the battery life so every once in a while I charge it when I sleep. I feel like it's a safe bet and it's harmless - I have a USB port hub for it anyways so why not?The LEDs are very bright and vibrant - again wasn't expecting that. A lot of mice I went through back in my gaming days with WoW and I've never seen LEDs this bright. The logo glows or throbs, however you wanna say it which I also didn't expect. Not sure if there's a way to change that but I didn't bother because I like it - it's very pretty.Overall, for a budget or a \"I don't wanna spend a lot of money right now\" kind of mouse, this really hit the spot. Feels like a 90$ mouse in my hand with the weight, grip, smooth surface, and of course being able to recharge it. My SteelSeries kept eating up a TON of batteries and that's why I was in the market. Glad I took a chance, since I don't know anything about this company, and considering buying a black version for my new rig on the way.The ONLY THING, and I mean the ONLY thing I'm disappointed about is that there isn't a matching keyboard to these very awesome unique colors. Very hard to match a baby-blue, yellow, and white mouse - it's so awesome but it doesn't match anything LOL. A bit of an oversight on my part. So now it's my spare laptop mouse until I order the black one. If they had matching keyboards for different colors NOW WE'RE TALKING. But obviously nothing to do with their quality, just an innocent mention if they're listening! <3",
        "I upgraded to this mouse from another mouse I found here on Amazon. This mouse is so much smoother than any others I've seen before, and comes with so many customizable settings for use and gameplay that I really appreciate! The rgb on this mouse is beautiful and so far hasn't glitched or failed me yet. I love the option to go wired or wireless with this mouse, as I tend to switch between the two depending on what I'm doing at my PC at the time. The design is nice and simple and I love that it came in pink to match my setup. The manual is very descriptive and covers everything you need to know about the mouse in a concise, easy-to-read manner. So far I love it. The DPI settings are evenly differentiated, and the scrolling options are standard, so they're easy to get used to! if you buy it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Definitely worth the price.",
        "Ergonomic, cute, colorful and very comfortable.  Ok I admit I was looking into the viper mouse but honestly? I thought this design was WAY BETTER. it has rbg lights, glows from the top, very fast cursor motion with multiple speeds and feels like a dream compared to my previous laughable travel size mouse. The size is really perfect for your hand and seems to be great for both gaming and scrolling.Our whole family loves the glowing lights and honestly I like it better than the viper now 🤭"

        "A nice little monitor. Good resolution and functionality.",
        "I am an electronics engineer by profession. I spend my days troubleshooting and repairing advanced electronics including computers, computer systems, power supplies, etc.I am also a ham radio guy and have built many ham radio projects over the years. I bought this product thinking to use it for my Raspberry Pi (4) that I use for various ham radio projects and how nice it would be to have a small, inexpensive display screen on my ham bench.1. It is a good size for looking at some screens that I use in my ham radio use.2.It is a small screen in that without a keyboard and mouse you are not going to find it very useful as a touch screen monitor unless you have small fingers. Unfortunately I ahve size 10 fingers and this screen is much happier with size 6 fingers .... so beware of this issue. I also find my iPhone  bit difficult to use in the touch mode .... maybe the term hamfisted is just right for me?3. The instruction for getting this unit up & running are , well, useless unless you know Chinese ...the english version is jut pictures and diagrams that leave some to be desired for clarity.4.DO NOT mount the pi board to the back of the screen as the heat it gives off is in my opinion just too much. Besides, you risk damaging you pi by being hamfisted like me. I did get my pi fixed and put it back into the original case and just connected the darn thing on the bench.5. I would have given it a much higher rating but felt that it was not as good a product as I expected. That being the case I am certain that others will of coruse disagree with me and that's ok.6. The company was very quick to shipp this item, it was very well packaged and I don't believe that there will be any problems using it in the ham shack. I just have to figure out cable routing and keeping the work desk clean.7. The visuals and color for it is absolutely top notch and I am satified with my purchase, the cables that come with it are not the best for my needs but that is a minor issue as the wones that work for me are easy to get.8. I have some other ham radio projects in design stage that this monitor will be perfect for and plan to buy more for that use .... no regrets on this purchase.Added more ifo: Here are some photos of how I ended up with the unit soa fer. It's just a temporary set up and one that will be needing modificatio to be useful on my crowded ham bench.I am definately going to add the bluetooth keayboard & mouse. Got to rid myself of the infernal cables ... they really detract from the goodness of this display.Photo 1 shows the display with the front view on the bench.Photo 2 is from the rear with th pi computer attached to the back of the display by velcro tape.Note all the cabling and teh mess it presents. Installing a wireless keyboard and mouse will clear up a lot of that wireing, and I'll try to make whats left cleaned up better.The finall installation will set on the upper shelf of my bench and the only use for it will be using my ham radio software for rig control and digital operations.",

        "I've long been a fan of Logitech game mice because of their initial fit/finish and reliability.  I momentarily went with corsair gaming mice and after 2 bad experiences, including one going completely DOA after a firmware update,  went back to Logitech.  I've never had a logitech mouse go DOA on me.  However,  over time.  I find that the soft-touch and rubberized coatings on their mice eventually become sticky.  Or even wearing off completely.  Mind you every logitech mouse still works.  It's just no longer pleasant to handle with the worn spots straight down to the plastic.  Even after wiping them down and washing my hands.  It feels like it's crusted over with many layers of red-hot cheetos dust.I've been a fan recently of EVGA's Z10 gaming keyboards with the Cherry brown switches.  So i decided to give the X12 mouse (white) a try.  The price was right at $19.99 on sale.  The mouse itself is light and absent of any kind of soft touch or rubberized coating.  Which likely means you won't run into the wear and tear issues associated with higher end mice with the \"nice when new\" coatings and surfaces.  The plastic itself reminds of of the textured white plastic used on the legendary Microsoft laser Intellimouse revered by old school FPS gamers.  The button clicks are crisp and precise.  The tracking is spot on.  The unleashed RBG software is easy to use and allows control over the RGB lighting over 3 separate zones with a handful of effects with various colors.  If you don't care for gimmicky effects,  you could always set it to static with any color of choice,  or turn it off completely.So far so good.  Time will tell how the X12 will wear.  But given first impressions and the cheap price.  I may consider picking up another X12 (white) to put into cold storage incase this mouse ends up being the GOAT.  Naturally i'll update this review (good or bad) as I continue to use this mouse.Update: A year later the scroll wheel starting acting up and jumping when scrolling in a web browser on sites like Amazon and Facebook.  Scrolling down very slowly will cause the page to scroll up instead.  To rule out it wasn't anything else,  I plugged my crusty old Logitech G402 mouse into the same USB port on the PC and kept the windows mouse settings the same and the annoyance completely vanished.  Scrolling became predictable and precise again.  Obviously an issue with the sensor tracking the movement of the scroll wheel.  I'll take this mouse to my workshop to blast it with some compressed air,  but at this point,  it doesn't look good in regards to longevity for this mouse if that doesn't resolve the issue.  Luckily I only paid $20 for it.",
        "I bought this mouse for my work because I'm at my desk most of the day and wanted a gaming mouse for the ergonomics and extra functions. I have a gaming mouse at home and love the feel. This mouse is super comfortable and functional! I saw in the reviews that the scroll wheel was flimsy. I say it has a little give, but that's because you can move it side to side to to scroll to the side, which I like. For the price, I like it! Let's see how long it holds up!",
        "I love almost everything about this mouse—the weight, the ergonomics, the DPI switches, even the sniper button (I don't play competitively so it's not a big deal to me, and besides, you can remap it).The MASSIVE con is that the scroll wheel will very likely break with heavy use. My first one busted after like four-five months; the second has lasted about 15 months, but just broke today.EVGA very likely knows about this flaw, and it's all over in their own forums, on Amazon reviews, Reddit, wherever. The wheel's axle is apparently super tiny and can't handle extended wear and tear for heavy users.By how many years this has been a problem, I wonder if it's somehow cheaper for them to just replace the mouse whenever someone files an RMA than to fix the design.Much less egregious of a con is that the rubber on the scroll wheel will probably start sliding over the wheel's plastic after not too long. I've needed to glue it in place for both, but that solved the problem both times and I've not had to think about it since.Sooooo brand loyalty? Get something else? That's up to you, but I don't like what at this point feels kind of like willful neglect by EVGA which otherwise makes pretty good products."

        "Bought to replace an X52 after frustrations with that throttle.  Both of these controls have some quirks, but overall I love them.  The stick is surprisingly sensitive.  I fly IL2 and do a good bit of formation work, and the stick is sufficiently sensitive to work this with no deadzones.  I put in the second to lightest included spring after the standard on lightest both weren't quite right for me.  The buttons are solid adn the hats are great.  A few other pros/cons:Pros:- Literally more hats than I can use.  I have one on the stick and one on the throttle that are essentially unused in IL2.- Overall build quality and precision is very good on the stick and superb on the throttle.- Love the split option on the throttle for multi-engine.- Bought rudder pedals when I got this, but actually prefer the twist-stick for rudder.  Works great (wish I could adjust the tension, but can't have everything).- Throttle rotary controls both incorporate a button push and a center of rotation detent.  Great control which I use for mixture/prop, boost/airbrakes.- Overall quality is less than Warthog or high-end EU stuff, but falls in 'just right' category for me.  Plugnplay w/ Win10 and key mapping is seamless within the game.Cons:- Lacks the two stage trigger from my old X52 - why???  That was a great feature!- Throttle is naturally VERY high friction.  Literally impossible to rapidly slam it to the stops.  I imagine this will make it last longer, but be ready to adapt your control style.  I cannot imagine many people using ANY of the included friction lock until they've had it a LONG time.- I love the toggle switches on the throttle, rather than on base of the stick like on the X52.  However, despite the sidebars, switches 1-6 sit directly under your wrist as it rests on the throttle.  This has led to a few inadvertent activations of these switches in-sim while flying.  Needless to say, I remapped Ctrl-E to a different toggle!  Its uncomfortable too.  Relocating and incorporating a smooth wrist rest would be better.- The two way pinkie slide on the front of the throttle has some issues and no longer returns to center after just a few months.  I use this for flaps so makes me check the control position any time I deploy them.- Both the stick and throttle incorporate a mouse-stick type control that I cannot utilize effectively.  No real need in my current games, and sensitivity would need a lot of tweaking.  I would really have  preferred a thumb button where the mouse-stick is on the stick.Bottom Line:  If it breaks, I'll get it fixed and keep using it, not replace with Warthog or other.  Sufficient for my use in IL2 and likely DCS and other sims as well.  I don't do Elite or space sims, but I imagine that it would be great there too.",

        "If you go on r/MechanicalKeyboards you'll see corsair keyboards getting a lot of flack for being overpriced for for their quality but honestly I don't really see it, I think the quality is good enough, it's no tank but for something that will just sit on your desk the whole time it really doesn't need to be. The mk.2 seems to be sturdy enough, the top is a fairly thick piece of aluminum, about as thick as I would expect a keyboard faceplate to be at least, and the whole thing is fairly ridged overall. The bottom of made of plastic and I see people complain that it's too thin but if you're not using your keyboard to bludgeon your enemies then it should hold up just finr. My biggest gripe with this keyboard are the keycaps, they're light, thin and laser ablated so they're likely to wear over time. Corsair offers a doubleshot version of these same keycaps, but they're another $50 so if you're set on getting those then this starts to become a nearly $200 keyboard. That being said, I think that if quality had to be sacrificed somewhere to meet this price point then the keycaps are the most logical option as they're the only part of the keyboard you can easily modify yourself if you want and I really don't see them as a huge problem until they actually start to wear. This keyboard comes with another set of WASD and QERF keys with a textured surface that won't wear so if you mostly use those it's probably not a huge issue. I suppose only time will tell how bad these keys wear.I was looking for several things in a keyboard, I wanted an aluminum top plate, a minimal, clean look, RGB and I wanted it to be mechanical and this keyboard meets all those things.I really like the brushed aluminum, it doesn't take on finger prints, it looks really good and it adds some good heft so full points there. The switches protrude out of the faceplate so there is nowhere for dirt and dust to fall in to and get trapped, this makes it really easy to clean with one of those compressed air cans so if you like to keep things clean then that is a huge plus. This is a really good looking keyboard, it doesn't overdo it by trying to look all gamery and wouldn't look out of place in an office or anything (with the RGB off at least), though you can see the pictures for yourself so whether you like how it looks is really up to you.The RGB is fully customizable on a per key basis but if you want all the fancy effects then you always need to have the corsair iCUE software running in the background which I'm not a huge fan of. You can save three RGB profiles onto the keyboards internal memory but the effects are a bit more limited if you chose to rely only on that. You can still set each key to any color you want and you can use some effects, but the effects can't be as elaborate as if you have the software running in the background. This isn't a huge problem for me because I don't really want much more than static back lighting anyway but its something you should be aware of. I guess each key can be readdressed to do whatever you want and you can make macros, but this particular model doesn't have any dedicated macro keys. These aren't really features that I've needed to use and so I don't particularly care about them.I got the version with the cherry mx brown switches because up to now I've been using a keyboard with blue clones and I wanted to try something different. I miss the clickyness of the blues but I like the feel of the browns well enough, I only wish that they were more tactile because the tactile bump isn't super prominent and isn't very sharp.  The browns are a lot less noisy that blues but they're still nowhere near silent. Most of the sound just comes from the keys bottoming out so it could be made just a little more silent with some o-rings but I don't like the feel of the o-rings as much. I considered returning this key board and getting the version with the blue switches for a little while but I've grown to like the brown switches, but it's all subjective. A lot of hard core mech keyboard enthusiasts don't really like browns but I don't have much experience with other switches so I can't say too much about that.The dedicated media controls are nice to have I suppose, but I only ever find myself using the volume knob. The wrist rest is just solid plastic but it has a soft texture and is definitely a plus, I haven't used one up to now but I don't think I could go without one in the future as it makes typing so much more comfortable. The USB passthrough is a nice feature, I use it for my wireless mouse dongle so that it's closer and the connection is more reliable but I imagine that it would be really convenient for a wired mouse as well, there are some routing channels on the bottom of the keyboard for the wire to keep things tidy if you do use a wired mouse . I don't think the passthrough wouldn't be ideal for something that you would remove and insert frequently because it's on the back of the keyboard which makes it awkward to get to in my opinion. The USB cable is braided and really thick which gives it a pretty premium feel. It's also super long so you shouldn't have much trouble getting it to where you need it to go. It's pretty ridged so if you move the keyboard around a lot on your desk that might be a bit of a problem.This keyboard really needs to be packaged better, Amazon just ships it in the box that the keyboard comes in and there isn't any foam or anything in that box so the only thing between the top of the keyboard and the boxes that will inevitably be dropped or stacked on top of it during shipping is a piece of cardboard. Because of this, my keyboard came with some of the keys knocked out both times, I replaced my first one because I thought it came broken. The first one's volume wheel was really loose compared to the second one I received, I don't know if that was a manufacturing defect or from rough treatment during shipping but it would be nice if Amazon just shipped it in another box with some proper packing material.",
        "I am Electrical Engineer, and have been working in the computer and chip design industry using computers on a daily basis for over 45 years, and this is by far the best keyboard that I have ever used, period.If I had to use one word to describe this keyboard it would be \"SOLID\".  It's a very sturdily built keyboard, so make sure you have a robust desk to hold it.  The mechanical MX Brown Keys switches are just \"perfect\".  They feel and sound great, and provide excellent tactile keypress feedback.  I have recently tried keyboards that use membrane switches, which felt dead and numb in comparison.  I don't think that I can ever return to a membrane switch type of keyboard.  These mechanical key switches really do make a BIG difference.There is a much better feel when typing on these PBT key caps vs the usual ABS key caps.  The surface of the keycaps is slightly textured which have improved my typing ability.  As a plus, the PBT keycaps are sturdier, longer lasting and will not exhibit the well known ABS key cap \"shine\" that develops over time.The K70 RGB Pro keyboard lighting is just right for my requirements.  I just want to clearly see the keys in the dark, so using a static color works best for me.  I do not need lighting zones, or fancy lighting effects, and as such I did not download or use the iCUE software used to do this.  The very nice thing about the K70 RGB Pro keyboard is that you can control the basic lighting effects (minus the real fancy ones you need the iCUE software for) on the keyboard itself just using the Fn key.  Even in max lighting setting, the K70 RGB Pro keyboard lighting is subtle and does not blind you like some of the other recent keyboards that I have tried.The angle profile of the keyboard is also ideal, not too low or too high, it is just at the right angle with the feet swung out.  I need my keyboards to have a palm rest, and so I was concerned as to the stability of the detachable one on the K70 RGB Pro.  The palm rest magnetically snaps to the keyboard, and there are two mechanical plastic tabs that keep the palm rest from moving from side to side relative to the keyboard.  This results in a very solid palm rest that seems to be built right into the keyboard.  The surface of the palm rest is not smooth but textured which makes it much easier to use.  The palm rest is hard plastic and not soft padded.  I personally prefer that since I think the surface of a soft padded palm rest would eventually crack and break.I am not a fan, and never use the \"Windows\" key on a keyboard.  On past keyboards I have been frustrated by the occasional accidental pressing of this key when trying to hit the \"CTRL\" or \"ALT\" keys around it.  The K70 RGB Pro keyboard has a \"LOCK\" function key that is used to disable the \"Windows\" key which works perfectly.  So the accidental \"Windows\" keypresses no longer happen when using my computer with this keyboard.Another key that I will occasionally accidentally press is the \"CAPS LOCK\" key.  On the K70 RGB Pro this results in a nice bright white \"A\" light getting lit on the top status panel.  Other keyboards I have tried just lit a round LED sometimes hidden just above the arrow keys on the bottom left side, which made it hard to notice.  The only negative I have with the K70 RGB Pro is that I wished they had made the \"A\" light just a tad larger and red so it would be impossible to miss.The audio control buttons on the upper right side of the keyboard are just your basic media buttons, which is all I need.  The most important ones are the mute and volume scroll wheel which work just fine.The K70 RGB Pro has three additional features that I do not use: 1) keyboard macro recording, 2) a tournament switch, and 3) a removable USB cable.  Perhaps I'll find a use for these features somewhere down the line.Before settling on the Corsair K70 RGB Pro, I recently tried and returned the Razer Black Widow V3 and Razer Ornata V3 keyboards.  The Black Widow keyboard had mechanical switches but they were very sensitive, the palm rest tended to slide sideways, the lighting was very intense, and the key cap surface felt way too high for my taste.  The Ornata uses membrane switches which felt completely dead and offered no tactile feedback, the palm rest also liked to slide sideways, and there seemed to be a sea of background light surrounding the keys, which again was way brighter than what I was looking for.  I found that I made a lot of typing errors on these keyboards when compared to my old Logitech G213 keyboard.In conclusion, the K70 RGB Pro is a well built keyboard that seems to check all the right points.  It even helps to make this poor typist feel like he's a world class typist.",
        "Upgraded from the red LED Mk. 1 version to the RGB Mk. 2 version after the cable on the first one failed.The RGB lighting is nice, I love the software used to control it. The Cherry Brown switches are a pleasure to use, and the keyboard is very solid. I love having the volume control on the keyboard.The changes from Mk. 1 to Mk. 2 seem to just be the lighted logo on the Mk. 2 and a slightly different volume knob. I think I preferred the Mk. 1 volume, the knob seemed heftier and easier to scroll. It felt nice to use. The Mk. 2 knob isn't bad, just not as nice. I do appreciate the lighted logo.One thing to know about this board is that it is HEAVY. The aircraft aluminum top is hefty. Feels nice, but if you carry it or are used to typing on your lap then it's something to consider. Also the edges are slightly sharp. If you dropped this on your bare foot it's going to HURT, probably break the skin...The cable is a concern. More expensive keyboards will have a removable cable. That would have meant I could continue using the older one when my cable broke. Instead I had to replace it.Another thing about this newer model is it has a loud pinging sound when typing. It's not spring noise. I did get some lube and lube the switches. That didn't help. It's resonance from the bottom plate which is hefty aluminum. There are potential solutions but none of them super easy."

If course, that could be a blank space filler in the picture. Also, the video outputs were display ports, not HDMI.Both problems were addressed by purchasing a $20.00 external DVD drive and a Display Port-HDMI driver. For the money, I am happy enough to buy one again knowing the shortfalls."

        "I purchased this for my son who we managed to get a decent gaming PC for his birthday, and after buying the PC, monitor, and wifi adapter our funds for the project were running pretty low, so this was the perfect combination of affordability, aesthetic, & functional.  I showed him the pictures and he agreed it was worth trying, and it was a good choice.  Plug and play makes for easy installation, and the keyboard, mouse, and pad all have great stability, the keyboard is pretty quiet since its not mechanical, and no need for batteries as it plugs right in via USB.  No complaints from me or my son, looks real nice too!",
        "The whole package, which includes a multicolored LED backlit keyboard, mouse, and even a headset, is a great deal and we have had no issues with it after testing it for HOURS AND HOURS of very intense 11 year old boy gaming. Installation was simple, it doesn’t take up a crazy amount of space, durable (I’m sure many can relate how boys can get fired up when they’re not winning and a headset or whatever else may or may not go flying through a room if they don’t win their battle royale or whatever the lingo is) and it’s all held up and completely still intact, a true testament to its stability. The headset helps reduce the noise of the other players, which unfortunately doesn’t reduce the noise coming from his room yelling at the games, but that’s not headset problem 😂 all in all, this was a great value for a great product! 5 stars for sure!",
        "It’s a very nice three piece gaming set. Easy to setup and comfortable. The buttons feel amazing and there’s no input lag on multiple buttons being pressed at once. The headphones suck, imo. I bought a different set of headphones. The mouse is nice but I prefer to have side-buttons, which this mouse does not have. The LEDs in the keyboard and mouse are nice, none on the headphones but it’s nice enough for late night gaming and it’s definitely worth the dollar."

        "The ORICO USB 3.0 hub clamp 4-Port USB splitter with 4.92 FT USB data cable was easy to clamp onto my desk, and with the nearly 5ft data cable I found it easy to mount the hub in a variety of possible places without needing to buy a USB extension cable.  Once clamped in place, the USB hub is sturdy and easy to use.  Eliminates the annoying issue of having to hold down a standard USB block hub in order to pull out a USB cable, and the minimal desktop footprint of the clamp on hub frees up valuable desktop space for other uses.My only complaint with the product is that I wish they produced a larger version with say up to 10 ports.  I bought multiple 4 port hubs, but then I have to use multiple USB ports on my computer to attach the hubs, or I have to daisy chain the hubs together.  One larger hub would be nice.  Still, the product is great, and hopefully, the company will consider producing larger versions in the future.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a simple easy to use space saving USB 3.0 hub.",

        "The keyboard mouse combo was delivered sept 16 2024. There is a lot I like about this product. The keyboard feels good to type on, and the mouse has good performance. For basic use these are good items. I would say that if you are a gamer, the mouse had some intermittent issues with response. NOT for gamers.All of that could lead to a good review except for a few glaring problems.1. The battery life on the keyboard is not comparable to other products. It lasts a few days, which is good, but there are other similar products that get better life.2. The keyboard has had intermittent issues where it will just stop working. This is not battery related. The fix has been a combination of restarting the keyboard, reseating the USB, or at times restarting the computer altogether.3. The mouse is dead. Did not last even 2 months and nothing I have done has been able to fix it.While I will be contacting customer support I don't have much hope for a decent resolution. Average customer support sucks in this day and age. I will edit this review with that experience at a later date.As of now, I would not recommend or buy from redthunder again.--Update--Redthunder was initialy kind enough to reach out and offer full refund. Awesome... right?No.I accepted, to which they then sent a canned how to on fixing a keyboard. wait, sorry, one little piece about fixing a mouse that wont pair. As my mouse is dead and wont turn on (yes I know how to charge it), neither of these will work for me.Still no refund.Had they not reached out, or said \"sorry, past the return date\", I would have written this off. But I despise people/companies who promise one thing then dont fallow through. Or just ignore in this case.One star. Horrid customer service, bad business, worse product... Do no purchase."

        "OK Boomer. I've had the privilege of being there nearly at the beginning. Learned TTL as a teen in 1965. Learned BASIC on GE timeshare in 1970. Learned assembly on PDP-8 in 1972. Got on ARPAnet in 1975. Owned my first computer in 1977. Point is I've been around building, modifying, and hacking computers and networks for half a century, yes, 50 years!  I have proof of everything I've just stated here.All that to say I've owned dozen of USB hubs in my lifetime. I've become picky partly since I no longer can afford to spend money on tech like I used to and partly since I've become more discerning about the products and their claims.Sorry for the blurry photos. I'm disabled, can't hold a camera steady, and tbh I'm just not very visually artistic.First photo shows some of the WD (Western Digital) Passport HDD's that I have collected throughout the years. I sometimes get them used since tools like CrystalDiskInfo will show you the hours on a drive and its health.Second photo is an older non-working hub (not the ACASIS) that I needed to replace. The 2amp power brick overheated, just didn't have the juice. The vendor is supposed to be sending me a replacement 4amp power adapter. After a week I couldn't wait. So I got the ACASIS to replace it.OK. Third photo is another hub (still not the ACASIS) that does still work. It's a 10-port and works well. I don't like the form factor - there are ports on 4 sides of the hub.Forth photo, more used HDD's, these are larger physical size (5.25\") and powered.The fifth and final photo, if you can see it, does finally show the ACASIS hub. It's my favorite.On to the review!I purchased this on an Amazon Lightning Deal just over a week ago. I can already tell it's better built than any hub I've owned thus far -- and there have been dozens (non-powered) and perhaps just a dozen of power hubs that I've owned and used. (not including those which are only chargers, oc)It's a 7-port powered hub and I have 7 WD HDD's attached to it. Most of the time the drives are idle and, presumably, don't require much power. But when I'm doing a search using a multi-threaded utility like Treesize Pro, it's possible for ALL the drives to be seeking away at the same time. This is when the power in the adapter and internal electronics of the hub are called upon to really work. That's why a robust, well-built, reliable hub is important to me.The design and build quality are excellent. I like the simple but aesthetic form factor. I personally don't need the individual switches atm. In the past, however, when multiple drives have an OS on them, the boot-up for Windows 7 especially but even on Windows 10 can get confused. (OK Boomer, I still like Windows 7.) Switching off drives with a boot sector and OS can be handy. No doubt there are other reasons to have switches.ASCIC also makes a 16-port USB 3.0 hub with a whopping 7.5A power adapter! (B07JM9ZFFV) This is on my Amazon wishlist.I'm particularly thankful the prompt and courteous Amazon messaging that I've received from rhodesxu customer service. They were kind and helpful to me. I'd recommend this hub to a friend and I'd buy it again myself -- except that I really want their 16-port hub when I have the cash for it!Thanks for listening.",

        "I have been looking for a high speed hub for my PS5. I wanted to put all of my peripherals in the rear of my PS5. Well this one works like a charm. External heard drive takes one of my 2 usb ports in back. This buys me 4 more. Pro controller dongle, headphone dongle, peripheral charger. All work together and I still have an extra port. Ten dollars and it was a super fix!!!!Great purchase!Fast, easy to operate, low cost!!! What more could you ask for.",
        "The multiple USB 3.0 ports are perfect for connecting all my devices—printers, external hard drives, and USB sticks—without any hassle. The addition of a USB-C power port is fantastic, allowing me to charge my laptop while using the hub. The 2ft cable is just the right length for my desk setup, providing flexibility without clutter. I appreciate that it works seamlessly with my Windows and Linux systems, and I’ve had no issues with speed or connectivity."

        "I recently upgraded to the 10th Generation Apple iPad, and I am absolutely thrilled! The A14 Bionic chip makes everything so fast and responsive—I can run multiple apps, play games, and stream videos with no lag. The 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display is stunning, with vibrant colors and sharp detail that make reading, browsing, and watching videos a joy. The 64GB storage is perfect for my needs, offering plenty of space for apps, photos, and files. Battery life is impressive, easily lasting through a full day of use. Overall, it’s an incredible device that feels like a powerful, portable mini-computer. Highly recommend this iPad for anyone looking for a sleek, high-performance tablet!",
        "I got this IPad as my birthday gift this year and so far it’s been absolutely fun to have! I’ve wanted an IPad for a long time now and I put in a lot of research as to which one I wanted and it is my very first one. First of all, it’s really just a lovely device to have, you can do SO MUCH with it. Second of all, the color options are really cute and as you can see, I went with pink. Third of all, the price point is very reasonable and fit my needs perfectly! The only issue I’ve faced thus far has been with the battery life. Doesn’t last “all day” for me. It needs to be charged after scrolling or watching YouTube videos after a few hours. I’m not going to complain on this issue too much however, because some of it has a lot to do with what I’m actually putting my device through. Such as the brightness level and apps running in the background and such. Overall, I’m very happy with this purchase! I cannot really compare with other models because as I stated, this is my first iPad. If you’re thinking of making this your newest addition, I would absolutely say go for it! If you’re a digital artist, get the pencil (USB-C) and go to town! Anyway, this iPad is just really fun and overall easy to use. I will enjoy it for many years to come hopefully! Thank you for reading my review! :)",
        "It’s lovely. Great size and the colour is really nice in person. Easy to set up. Great quality and battery life is great. Functionality is great. I definitely recommend"

        "18.0.1 iOS for iPhone 15 Pro. I can’t automatically pair. It starts to look like it’s going to pair but it doesn’t. I am disappointed because I think this is the way to see the headphone battery level. Overall I do like the sound and the fit is decent. I wear glasses and they don’t seem to bother me. I really like them, they sound great with the USB cord attached to phone. I’m happy with my purchase and the price. I have a hard time wearing AirPods because they hurt my ears and I’m prone to losing them or dropping them. This was a great solution. I just wish they would automatically connect. I did troubleshoot by resetting and turning the phone off and on. A new iOS just came out so I’ll see if that helps. If it does I’ll update my review.  People say it looks lilac which I was kind of hoping for but to me it’s just a very light pale pink. Update: 18.1.1 iOS did fix the issue of the not automatically pairing. I’m so happy because it has settings and shows the batter power, similar to just AirPods do. If you’re looking for headphones, I highly recommend. I never thought I’d buy beats, thought they were overhyped but I’m really enjoying them and glad I made the purchase, especially on sale. Im happy with the design, quality and functionality of the Beats Solo Pro 4.",
        "I’ve owned wired Solo Beats and wireless Studio(original for both) in the past and loved them. But when my Studios died after about 5 years, I settled on a cheap knockoff to get me by while I waited for a deal on real Beats. Then the day came that these Solo 4s went on sale for $99.99—half off! I’d been eyeing the black and gold pair for sooooo long. So I purchased them with a quickness. I love having that amazing Beats sound quality back! The quality of these headphones are great. Super easy to connect to my phone. Love the color combo of black and gold. And most of all, I love that I got such a good deal on them!",
        "Hey, so Beats became popular when I was in high school and I’ve had each pair of Solo Beats since. Most recently I had the Solo 3 that I loved, the sound was great and the bass was amazing. Unfortunately, the clamp squeezed my head like a tomato, the pressure in my jaw and ears were too much and I had to return them. So, when the Solo 4’s went on sale I was kind of iffy about getting them. I was underwhelmed when I heard the sound coming from the headphones on Bluetooth mode. There was no bass at all and the sound was muffled. I thought I got a bad one, so I thought maybe since it is now an Apple product that it must sound better plugged in… I was right. The volume increased, bass was a bit better and overall more suited to me. There is an upgrade in the comfort, the weight, and the inclusions. It comes with a charger, & audio cord unlike the solo 3. It is soooooo light and wayyyy more comfortable. I approve."

        "I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite.  Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears.  But the best feature?  Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds.  You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature.  No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears.  The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special.  And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available.  I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro.  Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average.  Great base.  Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear.  The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation.  With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in.  Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout.  They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear.  And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch.  The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear.  No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective!  I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try.  If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears.  These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched.  If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you.  The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base.  The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me.  Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder.  The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved.  The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard.  My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip.  The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation.  They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite?  The beats fit pro!  While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine.  My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts.  The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.",
        "I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features  I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world— they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.—THE SOUND—Both the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!—CONNECTIVITY—These connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don’t need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.—FIT—The fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)—THE CONTROLS—The controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON… which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button— it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.—BATTERY—The battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?—RANGE—Very good, about 30+ feet—CONS—-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn’t as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds— these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you—UPDATE—they have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case… which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived… only lasts two days generally",
        "I recently got the Beats Studio Buds, and honestly, they’re a game-changer. First off, the black design is super sleek and fits my style perfectly. When I first put them in, I noticed right away how comfortable they were – way better than regular AirPods, at least for me.The Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) is impressive too. I’ve tested it in some noisy places, and it really cuts down the background sound so I can actually focus on what I’m listening to. It might not be the same level as over-ear headphones, but for earbuds, it’s more than enough.Since they’re part of the Apple ecosystem, they pair up instantly with my iPhone, and the programmable buttons are a cool feature that makes switching tracks or activating Siri easy. Overall, these are solid earbuds that I’d totally recommend if you want something comfortable with good sound and a stylish look."

        "Let me begin by saying that this is my first experience with one of these drones. I purchased it because I had some roof damage a year ago and I am still dealing with an insurance claim. I have a tarp on my second story roof that has shifted out of place a couple of times already and I wanted a quick way to check it regularly without having to pull out a heavy 30-foot ladder and climb up there every time (one time was scary enough). I figured one of these simple drones would get the job done safely and on a budget. I was right, sort of.The controller seems very intimidating when you hold it in your hands because of the number of buttons and features, but it comes with a great quick reference card that sits right on top of the controls. It is very helpful and you can operate the drone while the card is in place. Every remote-controlled toy should come with something like this. In order to use the drone to its fullest capabilities, you need to attach a cell phone (cell service is not required) and download their app. I used an old Android phone that is not currently connected and only works on Wi-Fi. You can then connect the phone to the drone via its own Wi-Fi network.The app is fairly clear, but there are several features that have descriptions in Chinese even though most features are in English. I found no way to change those Chinese ones to English and it is my only complaint about the product and the reason why I knocked off one star on the Remote Control rating. That should be a simple software update so if that ever happens, I will update that portion to 5 stars. It does not affect functionality in any way as the descriptions appear to be for music that you can add to video captured by the drone. At least, I assume that is what the feature is for. One other feature was in Chinese and I could not figure out what it did. Neither feature is described in the instructions either.The instructions are otherwise pretty good and only have a few grammatical/translation errors, but you can still understand the explanations. They describe the features, but by far the best instructions are the quick reference card I mentioned above.As for the drone itself, it is compact, foldable, lightweight and comes in a great carry case. The arms fold out easily and it comes with guards that snap in at the end of each arm to protect the propeller blades.  While the package includes a couple of extra propeller blades, I do not recommend operating it without those guards. Those are a must and I will explain why.As I said, the drone is lightweight. That’s great for carrying it around but it makes it very difficult to control if there is even the slightest breeze. Thankfully, the joystick controls are very responsive and all of the buttons work well.I began by operating the drone in my living room and the air conditioner suddenly kicked on. The air from a nearby vent caused the drone to drift away and bump into a wall. Since the bumpers were attached, it gently bounced off the wall and continued hovering. That made me very cautious when I took it outside. There was a slight breeze on both days I that took it out. My yard has a cement wall on one side and a wooden fence on another, so I began by operating it near the corner. The app connected to the drone quickly, it started up perfectly and the camera quality is great when viewed on the phone.I tried flying up toward the roof and as soon as it got above the fence line it immediately fell victim to the wind. It was a struggle to navigate my yard which has tree branches, string lights and a pergola. I recommend flying it only in clear areas and when there is little to no breeze, but I suppose that is common sense. When operating it in the front yard I was able to go higher, but still struggled with directional controls. That is probably more attributed to my lack of experience with drone flight. I discovered “Headless Mode” which helped a bit. That shifts reference point of the controls to the drone’s position relevant to the operator than the direction in which the drone is facing. I read that this is a feature for beginners and I recommend staring with that turned on.The drone, like many entry-level drones, is not GPS enabled and does not have an automatic “return home” feature if it goes out of range or begins to run low on batteries. You need to be very aware of its distance from you and its battery life. I had about 15 minutes of flight time on a fully charged battery, which I have heard is fairly standard.I do not feel comfortable doing a thorough survey of my roof yet since some that will involve flying higher and perhaps losing sight of the drone as I circle my roof. I found myself focusing more on the position and distance of the drone that what was being displayed from the camera. That part is not a flaw of the product. I just need to practice a bit more and the weather has been too windy recently to allow that.I recommend this drone for beginners and the price point is great for this set of features, but if you are an advanced user with more complex or commercial applications in mind, this drone may not have the features and range that you need.  For what it is and claims to be, it is worth the 5 stars and I have no regrets purchasing it."

        "The Apple AirTag 4 Pack has proven to be an invaluable tool for keeping track of my belongings. These compact and powerful devices combine Apple’s sleek design with top-notch technology, making them the ultimate solution for anyone prone to misplacing items.Setting up the AirTags was a breeze. With the intuitive Apple ecosystem, pairing them with my iPhone took just seconds. The precision finding feature is outstanding, providing accurate directions to my items using the Find My app.One of the standout features is the ultra-wideband technology, which makes finding misplaced items incredibly precise. The audible alert is also loud enough to locate even in noisy environments. Plus, the seamless integration with Siri means I can simply ask where my items are, and get instant results.The compact design is a major plus.

They are a perfect blend of design, technology, and practicality. Highly recommended for anyone looking to keep track of their valuables!",
        "The AirTag is a necessity for travel.  Several airlines just announced they will use your AirTag data to help locate missing bags.  I always have one in each bag when I travel.Also good for pets, especially when you have inside cats that manage to slip out the door, or dogs that decide to explore on their own.",
        "I bought the pack of four for my first time and they worked perfectly. Once you get a case on them they become more durable, and it doesn’t interfere with their performance. After setting them up, they are easy to track down using my iPhone, which gives an accurate location."

        "So I bought a smart tv but it was extremely sluggish and not very smart 😂 it would switch HDMI inputs unprompted and randomly disconnect from the Wi-Fi so I went ahead and ordered this. Needless to say it outperforms the tv flawlessly, the set up was quick and easy and it’s literally plug and play. It updated itself when I turned everything on and from there it was smooth sailing. I like that it’s literally just a HDMI plug in and you don’t need any external devices that need to be mounted where the remote can send a signal. The tv is 4k output and so is the stick so the display is absolutely beautiful I tested it extensively 😂 my one complaint is the UI, it’s extremely over complicatedI literally only use this for like 3-4 apps but upon boot up, there’s like 50 apps shoved in my face 😂Other than that this is an amazing product at a very reasonable price !",
        "I have been using a fire stick I got in early 2019. Now (Sept 2024) i got this one. It’s been great. My old one got very hot and I’ve noticed this new one also gets hot but they’ve always worked. Must be normal operating temps. My old stick still works. I believe it's worth the update every 3-5 years. I also replaced my internet provider at the same time. When I 1st used this fire stick, my network was not the one I had saved on Amazon. (I had to change or rather add the new network to save on Amazon). The setup still went very smoothly. I stream at 1080 (on a 1080p tv)  but this  is 4K ready. The interface is much the same but a few UI changes are noticeable. I can tell the new one has more processing power. Well worth what I paid for the device. I have used Apple TV, MAX, Netflix, Hulu, MGM+, and YouTube. (Prime video) and others in the 1st week. All of these work well. People claim the Fire stick is for Amazon users, but it’s a cheap and easy way to use pretty much all streaming services.Amazon gets the concept of providing a low cost device that doesn’t overlook quality...to get business...however you can still easily use other services. These low cost devices like fire sticks, kindle readers, Echo dot, tablets, all Amazon devices I’ve used….high quality for a low cost. Do be aware that a lot of people have different education and views about tech than you or I might. I can still easily buy goods and services from almost anyone thorough this fire stick. Not just Amazon.Highly recommended by me !FYI - At the time of this review Hulu live tv does not work with T-mobile (or any) 5G home internet. That’s not the fault of the Amazon fire stick. It’s complicated but not a problem with fire stick (and I don’t even use Hulu live, so just the information for you)",
        "I was blown away by the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K! As someone who's been using streaming devices for years, I was skeptical about whether this tiny stick could live up to the hype. But let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations in every way.First of all, the setup process was a breeze. I simply plugged it in, downloaded the app, and I was up and running in minutes. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it perfect for my non-tech-savvy family members to use as well.The picture quality is STUNNING. Watching my favorite shows and movies in 4K is like experiencing them for the first time all over again. The colors are vibrant, the details are crisp, and the sound is crystal clear. I've watched some of my favorite movies and TV shows in 4K, and I'm blown away by how immersive the experience is.The Alexa integration is also seamless. I love being able to control my TV with just my voice, and the Echo dot I have in my living room integrates perfectly with the Fire TV Stick. It's so convenient to be able to search for shows or play music without having to reach for the remote.One of the things that really impressed me was the selection of apps available. Of course, all the major streaming services are there (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, etc.), but there are also some great indie channels and niche services that I wouldn't have expected to find on a streaming device.The only minor complaint I have is that the remote control could be a bit more robust. Sometimes it takes a few seconds for the commands to register, and it would be nice if there were more buttons for quick access to different features (like switching between apps or adjusting volume). But overall, these are minor quibbles compared to the many benefits of this device.In conclusion, if you're in the market for a new streaming device, look no further than the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K. It's an absolute steal at this price point, and I can confidently recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their streaming experience."

        "The Meta Quest 3 is hands down one of the best VR headsets you can buy right now, and it offers incredible value for the cost.

Here’s why I think this is a must-have for VR enthusiasts and newcomers alike.Design and Comfort – Built for Long SessionsThe Meta Quest 3’s design is sleek, comfortable, and clearly well thought out. The headset is lighter and more compact than its predecessors, making it comfortable for extended sessions. The padding is soft and conforms well to the face, while the strap system ensures a snug fit without feeling too tight. This is a huge plus for anyone who wants to game for hours on end or explore virtual worlds without constantly adjusting the headset.Display Quality – Crystal Clear VisualsOne of the most noticeable upgrades in the Meta Quest 3 is the stunning display. The high-resolution screens make everything look incredibly sharp and vibrant. Whether I’m playing high-intensity games or just exploring VR apps, the clarity makes everything feel immersive and lifelike. The colors pop, and there’s little to no screen-door effect, which makes a big difference in overall visual quality.Gaming Experience – Truly ExceptionalAs a gaming device, the Meta Quest 3 shines brightly. It delivers smooth performance across a wide variety of games, from intense action titles to relaxing VR experiences. The headset’s improved refresh rate and powerful processors ensure that even graphically demanding games run seamlessly, with minimal lag or stuttering. The Meta Quest Store offers a huge selection of VR games, so you’re not limited to a few options—there’s something for everyone, no matter your taste in games.Additionally, the Meta Quest 3’s controllers feel great in the hands, with responsive buttons and intuitive motion tracking. I’ve noticed that games feel more responsive, and the improved tracking makes it easier to aim, grab, and interact within the VR world. The Meta Quest 3 easily rivals the gaming performance of more expensive headsets, proving you don’t need to spend a fortune to get an incredible VR gaming experience.Ease of Use – Perfect for Beginners and Veterans AlikeOne of the best things about the Meta Quest 3 is how easy it is to use. The setup process is straightforward and user-friendly, taking just a few minutes to get started. Meta has done a fantastic job with its user interface, making it easy to navigate settings, download apps, and customize the experience to your liking."

        "They came to me just a few days ago and I can't stop admiring them. Their sound is excellent. And amazingly the noise blocking really works. It just looks magic. They look really elegant and small, and their case is also almost as small as the AirPods 2. I also enjoy the fact that they charge with Type-C and I really recommend them.",
        "As expected, these AirPods perform just as advertised. I tried Raycon and had a set of Beats Fit Pro and the sound quality of the AirPods is extremely better than the others. Before the beats I had a set of Bose sound sports and they were better than the Beats and Raycons but nothing compares to the crisp clean sound that comes from the AirPods. I was hesitant on buying the AirPods because of the price but they are well worth the price unlike the Bose sound sports. I will only use these from now on!!"

        "These are pretty cool. We use them for my kids room, our bathroom and my parents use in their kitchen. They work well in all locations. The moisture in the bathroom has not created any issues and I get it steamy a lot. The volume and sound quality are great for the price and there is no more delay than any other electronic. I am able to get it to connect to our receiver to stream to the speakers in the bathroom for improved sound. The video is what I was looking for and it’s been knocked off the counter a few times and still works great. For the cost this is a great product that I will most likely buy more of. The features are great and being able to see your answers you would normally ask Alexa on the screen is a game changer on occasions. I highly recommend buying if you are looking for an upgrade to the dots.",
        "I literally u this more than a dozen times a day.It has some new home networking features, such as Matter, over previous models. I don't really use the new features because I only have a half dozen automation devices but it will grow with me. (or more likely because of the great trade in privileges, I will just keep upgrading whether I need to or not.  I try to be frugal on most devices like tv, laptops and desktop , but amazon trade ins when stacked with discounts make so I wind up trading things inn all the time.The screen is the perfect size for me, doesn't take up too much room on the desk or nightstand, but big enough to see clearly. I experimented with the 10 inch size during one of the generation changes, but it wasn't good for my life style and home furnishings so I am back at the size I prefer.Sound it a little better, more 3D like, but this is no comparison to a soundbar (but it CAN be linked to a soundbar or bluetooth speaker). The alexa voice is a BIG differnce, more lifelike. When I got the new echo show, I compared it to the old echo show. I thought that alexa resided in the cloud and the voices would be exactly the same, but the new voice is more lifelike and actually has natural language cadence. It's the same camera. I don't care one bit if it is off to the right like the previous generation, or it is in the center like it is now.",

I love that you can control so many things with it if you have the right accessories.Screen: At first glance I though the whole top portion was a screen, but it's only a small square in the center. The screen itself is very bright and pleasing to look at. Touch screen is very responsive and decently customizable, from color to clock format, but I wish it had a few more options for how you want the clock to look like, though, it's not an issue at all.Connectivity: Very seamless and easy to handle with your phone (Alexa App). There are many options on how to use your Echo Spot and though I've only gone through a few, I've seen the rest of the things I can use the app for, and it is so versatile. I'm sure WiFi connectivity matters when it comes to response time between your phone and the Echo, but the response time was very quick in my experience.Cord: It brings a decently long cord. Would be nice if the plug was a bit less bulky, but again, minor inconvenience, not an issue at all.Overall, this is a solid product and I highly reccomend it if you've never had one. I did buy it with a few things in mind though. I wanted to get the most out of it, so I did order a fan and some light bulbs to control with it, and I can see myself wanting to get other things to use my Echo Spot with, however, the speaker on its own is still a great Smart Speaker/Clock.",
        "Let me start out by saying, these things are a breeze to setup up. All you do is download the app and follow the on-screen instructions. I had no issues setting up either one of the devices I bought and they both connected to my wifi flawlessly. I love the professional looking display and voice commands work very well aswell.Also, the sound quality on these is pretty good considering the cost. Sound quality isn't JBL Charge level good but it's definitely better than phone speakers. They are loud, clear, and even have eq settings you can set through the app. You can even set these Echos up to play music through all of your Amazon related devices at the same time which can be useful and save you a ton of money.Prior to purchasing these gadgets, I read mixed reviews on a lot of the things I mentioned, but I haven't experienced any issues. Some of the settings can be a pain to find, but overall, the app will walk you through setup step by step what you need to do to get them working and connected to your wifi. If you have connection issues, you need to check your network settings or your wifi range.My 2 complaints are, 1) the devices came caked in dust even though the box was sealed; and 2) the buttons could feel a little higher quality. I don't use the buttons at all due to voice commands and control through the app, but that may be an issue for some users.Something else I noticed was the horrible reviews linking the devices to Spotify. I didn't have these reported issues myself, so they could've been fixed with a firmware update, but it's definitely worth mentioning.I feel like a lot of these issues people are having are either network issues, or user related issues. If you take your time and follow the on-screen instructions, you won't have any issues. At the very least, my experience was great with them and yours will be too. I highly recommend this product.",
        "Purchased this when it was on sale for $45 and would recommend waiting for a sale to snag it at that price point. $80 just seems a little high for what it is. Besides the price point, this is a great little device with a very nice-looking screen. I wanted something a bit more simplified for the bedside to not cause distractions, as I don't need to see what's new on Netflix like on an Echo Show. Of course, Alexa integration works flawlessly with my other devices and home setup. Sound is actually pretty impressive with nice bass to boot. I have this set to start my morning with my Apple Music Playlist and it works great. Very much recommend, just wait for the sales that happen a few times a year."

        "I purchased this Echo Show to interface with a Blink Camera.  I had never used an Alexa enabled device and have found it is much more useful and fun than I expected.  This Echo Show sounds great when playing music and can provide a lot of information.  Setup was a little more complicated than expected and had to spend about 30 minutes before I got the hang of it.  Only down side of this Echo Show is that it does not have battery backup.  Always has to be plugged in to work.  Would buy again.",
        "UPDATEI am so happy to report that my echo show five is now working after I receive a called from customer service and they told me to press the mute button as well as the minus volume down button for 30 seconds after doing that show five restarted and I was able to reprogram it again and it is currently working so I am very very happy for the reach out by customer service, and the follow up to make sure I was satisfied. Thank you Amazon for your attention to detail and quick response regarding what I needed to do.Thank you J**** for the call and your patience.I bought this item in July 2023 and as of October 2024 the product has stopped working. It is stuck on the Amazon screen and I have done everything possible to reboot. The echo show five and still to no avail so I am stuck with a very expensive nonworking item.",
        "I have had many different Alexa devices and this one is my current favorite. It is super easy to use and even easier to set up using the Alexa app. I love how you were able to connect different devices such as your doorbell camera or outdoor cameras to this device. The speakers play music really well and the display is not too sensitive and looks great. There are also so many different games that you are able to play on the Alexa, which can be a lot of fun."

        "recently purchased the Vtiisamao Night Vision Goggles and have been thoroughly impressed with their performance.Packaging The product arrived well-packaged, ensuring that everything was secure and in perfect condition.These binoculars definitely exceeded my expectations in quality and clarity. I was a bit, unsure at the quality of the image, but I decided to give it a try, and I’m really grateful that I did.The binoculars have worked very well for me. The brightness is really helpful when looking out at night and the night vision is really clear. The focus dial makes things very clear and easy to see during the day and night! Definitely recommend for anyone working security at night time or for hunting at night these are great,,Overall, these night vision goggles are a great investment for anyone interested in nighttime activities. Highly recommended!",
        "Very lite weight unit. Fast setup, good instructions the night vision works fine, nice to have color. The IR light illustration is good, more of a spot light. The unit seems well built for the price, it comes with a neck strap. No lens xpcovers or case, but the shipping box is sturdy and well padded to store the unit.",
        "I saw these & were rated well. Good price, so I ordered.  they are not googles, like binoculars, they have a screen, more like a digital camera. They are light, they feel kinda cheap, & pretty basic.ButThey work pretty well. Pretty simple & easy to work with. I live along a woods line & my pets are always reacting to things I can’t see, but now I can. I’d say it’s a good value for the price."
